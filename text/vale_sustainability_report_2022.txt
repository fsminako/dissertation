ICMM principles:  
Environmental Performance   Conservation of Biodiversity  
Responsible Production
We express our commitment to environmental management 
through a declaration to achieve Net Zero Emission in scopes 
1 and 2 by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement. The nickel 
plant we operate in Sorowako has a carbon intensity of 27.30 
Ton CO2eq/Ton Ni, making PT Vale the company with the 
lowest carbon intensity in Indonesia. In addition, 
PT Vale started testing electric cars and trucks in Sorowako 
on January 14 and August 4, 2022. 
PT Vale has been progressively reclaiming post-mining land, 
targeting the reclamation of 70% of the total area by 2025, 
and rehabilitating watersheds. The area of land rehabilitated 
until the end of 2022 is 10,280 hectares, comprising 10,000 
hectares outside the operational area and 295.5 hectares 
within the operational area. We also planted 3.7 million trees, 
including endemic species.

Our Commitment to 
Community Development 
(Social) 
ICMM principles: 
Human Rights    Social Performances  
Stakeholder Engagement   Health and Safety
Since its establishment, PT Vale has been committed to benefitting 
community members in its working areas. The company has contracted 
11,000 local people, either as employees or suppliers/partners, 87% of 
which come from East Luwu Regency and other areas in South Sulawesi.  
To improve the quality of our human resources, we facilitated several 
of our employees to take an engineering study program at various 
universities, including the University of Hasanuddin. In addition, 
PT Vale facilitated and encouraged the relevant employees to get a 
professional engineering certificate and an engineering registration 
certificate from the Indonesian Engineer Association. PT Vale also 
established the Academy Teknik Sorowako (Sorowako Technical 
Academy), from which 1,516 people have graduated.
We contributed 44% to the Gross Regional Domestic Product of East 
Luwu Regency, the largest in the mining sector. Our support for the 
local economy can also be seen from the transfer of the Sorowako 
Airport to the provincial government of South Sulawesi through 
the signing of a deed releasing the Sorowako Airport between the 
President Director of PT Vale Indonesian Tbk and the Governor of 
South Sulawesi on May 12, 2022. Sorowako Airport management by the 
provincial government is expected to support tourism and agribusiness 
in East Luwu and South Sulawesi in general.

PT Vale places great importance on regulatory compliance 
in every activity aspect and conducts assessments of all 
development projects’ environmental, social, and governance 
(ESG) aspects, referring to ICMM and IFC related to carbon 
footprint, mine closure, indigenous peoples, and biodiversity 
management. To implement the operational plan in Bahodopi, 
we organized a public consultation and environmental impact 
assessment on July 29, 2022. We carried out the activity 
per Government Regulation No. 22/2021 on Environmental 
Protection and Management. 
During the public consultation, we confirmed our 
commitment to implementing sustainable mining practices 
according to the Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources 
Regulation No. 26 of 2018 concerning the implementation 
of good mining practices and mineral and coal mining 
supervision. PT Vale also applies the principles in the

Serving the 
communities by 
contributing to all.
From the beginning, PT Vale 
has served the communities, 
turning natural resources 
into self-sufficient areas, 
contributing to the 
development of the country. 
PT Vale is expected to serve 
the communities by providing 
them with what they need 
and want, including mining 
materials and other resources 
to improve their quality of 
life, while preserving the 
earth and creating prosperity 
for all.
Doing together.
Doing together means 
willingness to listen. 
Everyone must listen: society, 
governments, customers, 
and especially the people 
who are involved in PT 
Vale’s operations. After all, 
we are the communities. 
Communities are PT Vale. 
Doing together means 
creating a collective capacity 
to think, design, and realize 
possible futures for everyone. 
Doing together means 
acting with responsibility, 
transparency, and consistency; 
walking the talk, a system 
to enable PT Vale to always 
transform for the better. 
Using Vale’s 
mobility to 
do something 
extraordinary.
All mining companies 
are required to preserve 
the nature, protect the 
community and those 
involved in the Company’s 
operations. 
Transforming the 
future by taking care 
of the present. 	
We are generating development for 
communities, well-being for society 
and permanent environmental 
preservation mechanisms. Creating 
a better world than before PT Vale 
establishment. Putting the benefits 
intrinsic to mining at the service of 
society as a whole. 
In addition, we use the knowledge, 
human resources, and technical, 
financial and catalytic capacity 
that PT Vale has developed over 
the years to rebuild a virtuous cycle 
of prosperity that points to an 
inclusive and comprehensive future, 
in which everyone benefits and 
PT Vale’s horizons expand to meet 
the needs of a world in constant 
transformation. 
PT Vale implements a sustainability strategy through four pillar goals 
with a focus on five goals for the future.
Safety 
This is one of the key aspects to increase and regain 
public trusts. Ensuring safety of life and operations is 
Vale’s priority. 
People 
Our Company is built by human hands–they 
are the key elements to achieving the future 
we want.
Innovations 
Investing in innovations, leaving the comfort 
zone, is the main factor that makes our 
Company more competitive and profitable. 
Sustainability 
Contributing to improving environmental 
conditions, focusing on three dimensions: 
environmental, social, and governance. This is 
our new mindset: investing with a purpose. 
VPS  
A strong management mode is essential to increase 
the level of operational excellence. Having standards is 
our way of becoming a unified with Vale organization 
wherever we operate, as well as contributing to 
building a more reliable company.

renewable material mined in Sorowako. The 
total volume of nickel ore used in 2022 was 
11,552,911 MT. None of the materials come 
from recycling. We ship our nickel in matte 
in special packaging, entirely collected back 
by the buyers. [301-1a][301-2a][301-3a][301-3b]
Reducing Emissions 
Together
PT Vale’s Global Contribution
Climate change risk management is one of 
PT Vale’s sustainability focuses and is carried 
out following the Task Force on Climate-
Related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). We have 
set a Road Map Towards Carbon Neutral 
2050. The short-term targets are energy 
efficiency and optimized use of renewable 
energy; the mid-term target for 2030 is 
33% absolute emission reductions from 
scopes 1 and 2; and the long-term target 
for 2050 is to become carbon neutral (net 
zero emission). [EM-MM-110a.2][TCFD Strategi.a] 
We believe energy transition is one of the 
keys to success in controlling climate change 
and limiting global temperature increase 
to below 2oC, a goal the Paris Agreement 
reaffirms. Nickel, which is PT Vale’s product, 
will be a vital commodity in the energy 
transition, especially in building renewable 
infrastructure and supporting electrification 
through electric vehicles. An increase in 
the demand for nickel will lead to the 
Company’s positive financial performance in 
the coming years. [TCFD Strategi.b][TCFD Strategi.c]

GHG Emission Calculation 
and Reductions  
 [POJK51-F.11] [POJK51-F.12]
We calculate GHG emissions from activities in 
Sorowako, including scope 1 emissions from 
production activities and fuel consumption and 
scope 2 emissions from electricity consumption. 
The calculation results are expressed as total 
GHG emissions in tons of CO2eq, including the 
conversion of non-CO2 GHG emissions (CH4, 
N2O, and HFC). We do not calculate biogenic 
CO2 emissions. The calculations use the energy

to data update. [2-4]
PT Vale’s low GHG emission intensity can be attributed to three 
hydropower plants, which can avoid additional scope 1 emissions 
equivalent to 1,118,231 tons of CO2eq per year if calculated based on the 
fuel volume used for a diesel power plant or 2,292,375 tons of CO2eq 
per year using coal for a steam power plant. We continue to develop 
opportunities to reduce GHG emissions from production processes with 
a potential of 1,800 kilotons of CO2eq, or 90% of the total GHG emissions. 
Another opportunity is mining areas with potential GHG emission 
reduction of 200 kilotons of CO2eq. [305-5a][305-5b][305-5c][305-5d][305-5e]
PT Vale reduced its GHG emissions by 330,688 tons of CO2eq to 1,640,387 
tons of CO2eq in 2022, 17% lower from 1,971,075 tons of CO2eq in 2021. 
Overall, the total GHG emissions up to 2022 have cumulatively decreased 
by 373,563 tons of CO2eq, from the 2017 baseline of 2,013,950 tons of 
CO2eq. This achievement is still in the projected net zero emission roadmap 
which will be gradually implemented at PT Vale. However, we also recorded 
that there are fluctuations in the volume of GHG emissions every year, 
influenced by the proportion of fuel used in operations and the amount of 
production. We are committed to reducing absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions from scopes 1 and 2 by 33% by 2030 and achieving a net zero 
emission by 2050.

In 2022, we made the following efforts to reduce GHG 
emissions:   
•	Electric car and charging station trials to support the Energy 
Department’s operations in the Sorowako area until Malili. 
The trials have been carried out, covering a distance of 
10,326 km and reducing 2.73 tons of CO2eq.
•	Trial of an electric truck starting August 4, 2022, in 
the Sorowako Block for a year. The truck has a payload 
capacity of 70 tons and runs on 100% electricity. The 
operationalization of one electric truck can potentially avoid 
604 tons of CO2eq per year, which is otherwise emitted by a 
conventional truck.
•	PT Vale participated in the Indonesian Climate Change 
Expo & Forum (ICCEF) 2022 organized by the Ministry of 
Environment and Forestry.
•	PT Vale actively participated in several forums, including 
COP-26, COP-27, and the Kadin Net-zero hub.
Emissions Containing Ozone-
Depleting Substances (ODS) 
PT Vale no longer uses HCF-22 
(CHF2Cl) freon and has replaced 
it with R32 freon, which is a non-
ozone depleting substance, as it 
has an Ozone Depletion Potential 
(ODP) value of 0 and a Global 
Warming Potential (GWP) value 
of 675. All R32 freon is purchased 
from suppliers. We have yet to 
calculate the volume of R32 freon 
used, disallowing this Report to 
include an explanation of the 
calculation method and results.

Low-Emission Technology 
for New Plants
In this reporting period, PT Vale agreed to 
cooperate with various parties to establish 
new processing facilities in Bahodopi, 
Pomalaa, and Sorowako. The factory in 
Bahodopi will use eco-friendly technology 
and phase in liquefied natural gas (LNG) as 
an energy source for reduction kilns and 
furnace at RKEF, making them low emissions. 
In a projection prepared by an expert team, 
in 2030 the factory/processing facility in 
Bahodopi will be a factory with the second 
lowest emission intensity in Indonesia after 
PT Vale’s factory in Sorowako.
The same is true for the new HPAL plants in 
Pomalaa and Sorowako. We are committed 
to developing them without using coal for 
energy to slow down climate change. 
Managing Energy Together
to Support a Low-Carbon 
Economy
About Vale Power Shift (VPS)  
We follow the Vale Global internal program, 
VPS, to support the transition to a low-
carbon economy. The VPS aims to improve PT 
Vale’s energy matrix by focusing on the use of 
renewable energy and alternative fuels and 
efficiency by using new technologies. VPS-
related initiatives are expected to contribute 
around 5% of the planned reduction by 2030. 
In addition, we carried on our debottlenecking 
project in 2022, scheduled to be completed 
in 2024. To meet our energy efficiency 
commitment, PT Vale has been ISO 50001 
certified for energy management systems.
As a follow-up to the cooperation in building 
nickel processing facilities (smelters) in the Xinhai 
Industrial Park, Bahodopi, and Morowali, and 
a High-Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) smelter 
in Pomalaa, we plan to use LNG and electricity 
supplied by the State Electricity Company PT 
PLN (Persero) to meet the energy need of RKEF 
in Bahodopi and HPAL in Pomalaa, respectively. 
In this reporting period, we initiated a dialogue 
with the Special Task Force for Upstream Oil and 
Gas Business Activities (SKK Migas) to ensure 
domestic LNG supply.  
Energy Consumption and Efficiency 
[POJK51-F.6]
Energy consumption calculation includes the 
volume of energy consumption for heavy 
equipment used during nickel ore mining 
operations and nickel in matte production 
in the Company. We do not calculate energy 
consumption outside the Company. The 
consumed energy is sourced from hydropower 
– which is renewable, thermal power, and fossil 
fuels – which are not renewable. The total 
energy consumption is calculated by adding 
up the volumes of all energy sources used. 
The result is converted into Gigajoule (GJ) 
based on the International Energy Agency (IEA) 
conversion.  [302-1a][302-1b][302-1e][302-1f][302-1g] [302-2]
The total energy consumption in 2022 was 
26,689,441 GJ, a 6.52% decrease from 28,551,417 
GJ in 2021. The consumption of hydropower 
biodiesel B30 was 7,797,981 GJ and 580,915 GJ, 
representing 29.72% and 2.18% of the total 
energy need; the remaining 18,175,588 GJ, or 
68.10%, is non-renewable, 9.054.678 GJ  of 
which was from marine fuel oil (MFO), an 
increase from 8,087,926 GJ of MFO used in 2021.

Energy Consumption Reduction [POJK51-F.7]
A comparison of energy consumption reveals that we have been 
able to reduce 5,415,794 GJ in energy consumption compared to 
the 2017 baseline and that the total energy consumed in 2022 
was lower than in 2021 as the result of energy efficiency policy 
adoption, including: [302-4a][302-4b][302-4c][302-4d]
•	Use of biodiesel B30, which contains 30% fatty acid methyl ester 
(FAME), thereby reducing the use of fossil fuels by 30%;
•	Trial of one electric truck, which can save 276,000 liters of 
Biodiesel B30 per year.
This report does not include a calculation of the energy efficiency of 
products and services sold in 2022. It is because our nickel in matte was 
transported using ships provided by the buyers, eliminating energy 
calculation based on fuel consumption volume conversion from PT 
Vale’s responsibility. [302-5a][302-5b][302-5c]

PT Vale supports the transition to new 
and renewable energy by developing 
nickel-based new and renewable energy 
through the production of batteries for 
electric cars, thereby supporting the 
transition to a low-carbon economy. 
We focus on realizing our strategic plan 
for the next five years by preparing 
nickel processing plants in Bahodopi 
and Pomalaa. The HPAL plants in 
Pomalaa and Sorowako will produce 
Mix Hydroxide Precipitate (MHP), raw 
materials for electric-car batteries. 
PT Vale’s mining costs are divided into 
22% for Pre-mining Conservation, 53% 
for the mining itself and 25% for Post-
mining Conservation.
Mine Land Reclamation and 
Biodiversity Conservation Together  
[POJK51-F.10]
Environmental Cost  [POJK51-F.4] [MM10][304-3b]
We have a Mine Closure Plan, drafted in 2009, approved in 
2015, and renewed every five years. We have communicated 
this plan to stakeholders, including the government and 
surrounding communities. The plan covers the entire (100%) 
mining operation area in Sorowako. PT Vale also guarantees 
mine closure. Provincial financial allocations, which 
include an environmental cost component in our Financial 
Statements, support our commitment to land reclamation 
and rehabilitation. Our actual environmental management 
cost in 2022 was US$20,142,498 for Sorowako and Pomalaa. 
Watershed Land Rehabilitation Outside CoW 
[EM-MM-160a.2]
Former mine land reclamation aims to improve land 
ecosystems, endemic flora and fauna conservation and 
protection, and compliance with Government Regulation No. 
78/2010 on Reclamation and Post-Mining. We are committed 
to limiting the open land areas for mining operations 
and managing biodiversity in the mining operation areas 
following Approval Letter No. 188.4/66/II/BAPEDALDA. 
We also carry out land rehabilitation and transboundary 
reforestation activities outside the mining operation 
areas, particularly in critical land and watersheds, per 
Regulation of the Minister of Environment and Forestry No. 
59/2019 on Planting for Watershed Rehabilitation. We have 
rehabilitated watersheds in 13 South Sulawesi districts and 
three West Java districts. PT Vale’s mining costs are divided 
into 22% for Pre-mining Conservation, 53% for the mining 
itself and 25% for Post-mining Conservation..
PT Vale Obtained ISO 50001: 
Energy Management
In November 2022, PT Vale obtained an ISO 
50001 certificate issued by TÜV Rheinland. 
ISO 50001 is a globally-recognized standard 
that sets requirements for developing, 
implementing, maintaining, and improving 
an energy management system in a 
company. 
The Company’s Energy Management team 
has made thorough preparation since 2020. 
It ensured its ongoing and new energy 
efficiency programs were well implemented 
according to standards as a continuous 
improvement effort.
The ISO 50001 certification is a critical 
milestone in the Company’s effort to 
meet the commitment to reducing and 
neutralizing greenhouse gas emissions, 
consistent with the statement in the 26th 
Conference of Parties (COP-26) in 2021 in 
Glasgow, Scotland. In the national nickel 
mining arena, even among Vale companies 
globally, PT Vale is the only one able to 
obtain ISO 50001.

Tanjungmekar Sub-district in Sumedang, Parigi Sub-
district in Pangandaran, and Cikalong, Cipatujah, 
Karangnunggal, and Sodong Hilir Sub-districts in 
Tasikmalaya. We will carry out the rehabilitation 
until 2025. By the end of 2022, we have planted 25 
Ha in Sindang Jaya Village, Cikalong Sub-district, 
Tasikmalaya District. We will plant another 410 Ha 
in 2023. Furthermore, PT Vale handed over 140 Ha 
of critical land in a rehabilitated watershed to the 
Ministry of Environment and Forestry in 2022. The 
handed-over land was in Pongkeru sub-watershed 
in Ledu-Ledu and Kawata Villages, Wasuponda Sub-
district, East Luwu District, South Sulawesi.
Post-Mining Rehabilitation Activities
PT Vale’s mining operation areas are privately owned based on a 
Contract of Work with the Government of Indonesia, which was 
amended in 2014. Some of the operation areas are in protected forests. 
We have obtained Borrow-to-Use Forest Permits (IPPKH) from the 
Ministry of Environment and Forestry to use the protected forests. 
[304-1a][EM-MM-210a.1][EM-MM-160a.3]
PT Vale carries out open pit mining activities, resulting in changes 
in the natural setting, ecosystems, and biodiversity. To minimize 
the impact, we adopt a policy of limiting the area cleared for mining 
activities every year, according to the application document for 
the revised reclamation guarantee for 2021–2022 approved by the 
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources. Accordingly, we limited 
the area we could clear in 2022 to a maximum of 1,981.57 Ha in 2022. 
The size of land newly cleared for mining operations in the reporting 
period was 199.80 Ha, making the total area used for mining 
operations as of late 2022 to be 5,458.60 Ha. [304-2b] 
Our post-mining rehabilitation 
program involves trained 
local communities, NGOs, the 
government, and a third party. 
The Ministry of Energy and 
Mineral Resources regularly 
monitors and evaluates 
its success to ensure the 
rehabilitated areas are 
eligible for handover to the 
government through the 
Ministry of Environment and 
Forestry. The success criteria 
include land use, revegetation, 
and final settlement standards, 
according to Regulation of 
the Minister of Energy and 
Mineral Resources No. 26/2018 
and Decision of the Minister of 
Energy and Mineral Resources 
No.1827K/30/MEM/2018 on

Protecting Biodiversity [POJK51-F.10]
We manage the species affected by our 
mining activities by identifying and relocating 
them to other areas, including post-mining 
rehabilitated areas. The total area we 
reclaimed in 2022 was 295.43 Ha, or 1% of the 
293.44 Ha target, with 179,993 trees planted. 
We target over 10,000 Ha to be reclaimed and 
rehabilitated by 2024. We are gradually handing 
over the rehabilitated areas to the government 
for reforestation. For example, in 2022, PT 
Vale handed over 140 Ha of critical land in a 
rehabilitated watershed to the Ministry of 
Environment and Forestry. The handed-over 
land was in the Pongkeru Sub-watershed, 
stretching across Ledu-Ledu and Kawata 
Villages in Wasuponda Sub-district, East Luwu 
District, South Sulawesi Province. [304-2a] [304-3a]
[MM1]
PT Vale is committed to conserving protected 
and endangered fauna and flora species. A 
study conducted in collaboration with the 
University of Hasanuddin in 2020 found 43 
protected species based on the IUCN Red List 
in our mining operation area in the Sorowako 
Block. The species list can be found in the 
Appendix hereto.  [304-4a][MM2]
Reducing Landfill 
Loads Together
Solid waste we produce consists of non-hazardous and 
hazardous waste. We still adopted the policy of reducing 
landfill loads in 2022, referring to the PROPER policy, by 
optimizing the management of waste produced from our 
mining operations, production processes, and supporting 
and domestic activities. Prior to the final waste disposal 
stage, we treat our waste through efforts to reduce, 
reuse, recycle, and recover (4R). In the reporting 
period, no hazardous and toxic waste was shipped 
internationally, and no environmentally endangering 
waste was spilled.  [POJK51-F.13][POJK51-F.14][POJK51-F.15] [306-3][306-

Reducing Water 
Consumption Intensity 
Together [POJK51-F.8]
We pursue optimized water consumption 
for every ton of nickel in matte produced, 
in line with PT Vale’s Water Efficiency and 
Wastewater Pollution Reduction Policy. This 
policy can be found at https://vale.com/our-
policy.
The biggest need for water is for 
hydropower operations on the Larona River, 
with water supplied from Lakes Matano, 
Mahalona, and Towuti. Water from the lakes 
flows into a reservoir and is channeled to a 
canal to move the turbine. The amount of 
water consumed is the same as the water 
extracted from the lake, and no water is 
extracted from the water stress area. [303-3]
The locals also utilize lakes Matano, 
Mahalona, and Towuti for their domestic 
needs, as a livelihood source for those 
who work as fishers and farmers, and as a 
transportation route. PT Vale regulates 
the water volume and discharge for the 
hydropower to ensure that the lakes are 
preserved and can still be utilized by the 
community. We are also committed to 
protecting the three lakes to support 
their status as a Natural Tourism Park 
Conservation Area based on the Decision of 
the Minister of Agriculture No. 274/Kpts/ 
Um/4/1979 dated April 24, 1979. [303-1][303-2]
[EM-MM-210b.1] 
The total water consumed in 2022 was 
8,519,762 m3 (equivalent to 8,519.167 
megaliters), a decrease of 161,558 m3 
(equivalent to 161.558 megaliters) or 1.86% 
from the 8,681,643 m3 consumed in 2021. 
The water consumption intensity in 2022 
was 141.77 m3/Ton Ni (0.14 megaliters/
Ton Ni), higher than the 132.85 m3/Ton 
Ni (0.13 megaliters/Ton Ni) in 2021 due 
to a decrease in production. We report 
our water consumption intensity to the 
authority and the public via https://vale.

Environmental Sustainability Management Performance 
In 2022, PT Vale made the 
following efforts to make 
water consumption more 
efficient:
•	Reducing and controlling 
leaks in water supply 
pipelines in its operation 
areas;
•	Controlling and reducing 
water overflow from the 
matte pond; 
•	Implement a water 
efficiency program in 
PTVI’s business process 
flow based on the Hotspot 
Life Cycle Assessment 
(LCA) and Water Audit;
•	Raising employees’ 
awareness of water 
efficiency and reporting 
daily water consumption 
in daily FMDS meetings;
•	Making water 
consumption intensity 
a KPI.  
Impact of Wastewater 
and Its Management  
[POJK51-F.9] [POJK51-F.14]
We regularly analyze 
processed effluent that 
will be discharged to 
Lake Matano through its 
tributary. The purpose is to 
ensure compliance with the 
quality standards according 
to the Regulation of the 
Minister of Environment 
No. 9/2006 on Wastewater 
Quality Standards for Nickel 
Ore Mining Businesses and/
or Activities. We usually 
commission an accredited 
independent laboratory to 
conduct the analysis using 
the SNI 6989.59:2008 Water 
and Wastewater method 
and the American Public 
Health Association (APHA) 
standard method. An 
analysis conducted in 2022 
found that the quality of 
our processed effluent met 
the quality standards. [303-4]

Compliance, Complaint Handling, and 
Evaluation of Suppliers/Work Partners 
[POJK51-F.16]
In managing the environment, PT Vale complies with 
all applicable regulations. We use an application 
named the Regulation Compliance System (RCS) and 
adopt global standards for regulation compliance, 
enabling us to access and identify our compliance 
level. The Environment Committee, comprising 
senior managers and directors, also evaluates 
the Company’s environmental management 
performance. We work well with independent 
parties, including Bureau Veritas, an external auditor 
that evaluates our environmental performance. An 
evaluation carried out in 2022 found that we had 
100% compliance. We ensured that there were no 
suspicions of environmental management non-
compliance that could make PT Vale receive fines or 
other legal sanctions. [2-27a][2-27b][2-27c][2-27d]
PT Vale also regularly evaluates its suppliers’ or work 
partners’ environmental management performance. 
During 2022 evaluations have been carried out for all 
(100%) new suppliers/work partners. Based on the 
evaluation carried out, there was no termination of 
the work contract with the supplier/work partner 
because they did not manage the environment 
according to PT Vale’s regulations and standards. [308-

Commitment to 
Human Rights
Our human rights policy is laid down in 
our Code of Conduct (CoC) and refers to 
the United Nations Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights. PT Vale is 
committed to respecting, protecting, and 
remedying the human rights condition in 
the Company and of all stakeholders. This 
commitment is also realized through PT 
Vale’s participation in the membership 
of the United Nations Global Compact 
(UNGC).  [2-23b][EM-MM-210a.3]
Promoting Equality and 
Diversity [POJK51-F.18] [EM-MM-210a.3]
PT Vale has a Diversity and Inclusion 
Charter, setting out the Company’s five 
commitments to diversity and inclusion. 
We encourage raising employees’ 
awareness of gender equality and 
diversity through programs targeting 
supervisors and above. During 2022, 
PT Vale conducted training related 
to diversity and inclusivity which was 
attended by 711 participants.
We provide opportunities equally to everyone who works and 
pursues a career at PT Vale. Every process is gone through 
without looking at gender, ethnicity, religion, group, political 
affiliation, physical restrictions, and other discriminatory 
reasons. In 2022, we never received allegations of discrimination 
in the workplace. [406-1a][406-1b]
In 2022, 102 new employees were recruited, consisting of 
88 (86.3%) men and 14 (13.7%) women, while 134 employees 
left the Company. We provide allowances and other facilities 
by taking into account employees’ employment status and 
placement. PT Vale gives 120 calendar days’ leave to female 
employees who are about to give birth and two calendar days 
(on-site) and three calendar days (off-site) to male employees 
to accompany their wives in childbirth. All female employees 
who have completed their maternity leave have returned to 
work in the same position; none resigned from PT Vale. 
[401-1a][401-1b][401-2a][401-2b][401-3a][401-3b][401-3c][401-3d][401-3e]
We are gradually increasing the number of female employees. 
By the end of 2022, the number of female employees had 
already reached 256 people or 8.7% of thee total employees. 
Of this number, 25 people, or 8.3% of the total employees, held 
a managerial post, with General Manager as the highest rank, 
and 11 people, or 4.3% of the total female employees, were in 
the management. [405-1a][405-1b] 
PT Vale also accepts competent and able people with 
disabilities for vacant posts. The number of employees with 
disabilities in 2022 was four people, one more employee 
than that in 2021, representing 0.1% of the total employees. 
The Company recruited them as non-staff and senior staff 
employees. [405-1a][405-1b]
Diversity and Inclusion Charter
Our commitments to diversity and inclusion:
1 
Create an 
environment 
that respects 
everyone’s 
uniqueness, in which 
everyone has an 
equal opportunity 
to develop their 
potential.

Support for the Trade Union and 
Collective Labor Agreements 
Nothing hindered employee activities in unions 
or establishing a trade union in 2022. Through 
representatives in the trade union, employees 
and the management drafted and inked the 19th 
Collective Labor Agreement for 2021–2023, according 
to Law No. 13 of 2003 on manpower. The Collective 
Labor Agreement was aimed at protecting all 
employees and workers, while the protection of 
foreign workers (expatriates) refers to the senior 
management book. The Collective Labor Agreement 
regulates the notification process to employees 
of any changes in the Company’s operations. To 
support human rights (HAM), PT Vale also supports 
association and assembly activities which are held 
periodically. [2-30a][2-30b][407-1a] [407-1b][402-1a][402-1b] 
Percentage of the Lowest Remuneration 
Against the Minimum Wage [POJK51-6.c.2.b]
PT Vale remunerates male and female employees 
in a ratio of 1:1. The amount of remuneration 
also takes allowances and placement incentives 
at Sorowako, Bahodopi, and Pomalaa mines into 
consideration. In general, the lowest remuneration 
PT Vale employees received in 2022 was 114% 
higher than the minimum wage requirement in 
East Luwu District. [POJK51-F.20] [202-1][405-2a][405-2b]

consisting of 2,678 men (91.28%) and 256 women 
(8.72%), making the average training hours to the 
total employees 40 hours. In addition, the Company 
organizes special training for employees about to retire 
to help them become self-employed or do other jobs 
after retirement. In this reporting period, 49 employees 
participated in special training on: [404-1a][404-2a]

evaluation results of all employees’ performance. 
In 2022, 439 employees were promoted, consisting 
of 399 men (91%) and 40 women (9%). [404-3a]
Preventing Forced and Child Labor [POJK51-F.19]
There were no reports of forced labor in 2022. PT Vale 
applies a working-hour rule according to Law No. 13 of 
2003 on Manpower and compensates employees for 
every extra working hour they do. We also ensure that PT 
Vale’s and contractors’/vendors’ activities do not involve 
child labor by setting a minimum age of 18 years old for 
employees or workers according to the Manpower Law 
and International Labour Organization (ILO). Further, 
no employee strike ever occurred during the reporting 
period. [408-1a]408-1b][408-1c][409-1a][409-1b][MM4][EM-MM-310a.1] 
Managing Social Impacts on Vulnerable 
Groups and Local Communities
One of our priorities for social impact management 
is local community groups that are considered 
vulnerable groups. We are aware that our approach 
toward the local community groups is not a one-
size-fits-all approach, but not to the point of 
creating a conflict between the Company and the 
local community groups. We continue to improve 
coordination and synergy with the government of 
East Luwu District to obtain their input, direction, 
and guidance on a shared expectation of opening 
up more work and business opportunities for the 
local communities. One program we carried on in 
2022 was the Sustainable Environmental Friendly 
Healthy Agriculture and Fisheries Development 
Program (P3SRLB Program). [413-1][EM-MM-210b.1]

persons with disabilities 
in entrepreneurship to 
achieve self-employment 
and develop a superior 
livestock area in Matompi 
Village, Towuti Sub-district, 
East Luwu, by donating 
chicken coops and organic 
free-range chicks to youths 
with disabilities, members 
of the ‘Woliku’ livestock 
group in Matompi Village,

One of the three blocks 
where PT Vale operates, 
has local people, the natives 
acknowledged and recorded 
in an agreement. During 
the reporting period, the 
Company did not have any 
conflicts with them, and no 
relocation was made as a 
result of mining operations. 
We keep improving our

Human Rights Training of 
Security Guards
Security guards carry the duties and responsibilities 
of securing the Company and its assets. During 
the reporting period, the Company had 407 
security guards, consisting of employees and two 
outsourced workers from a certified security service 
provider registered with the Indonesian Association 
of Security Service Businesses. All security guards 
held a training certificate issued by the Indonesian 
Police, with Gada Pratama (basic) and Gada Madya 
(intermediate) qualifications, according to the 
Indonesian Police Chief’s Decision No. 4 of 2020 on 
Independent Security. Topics on law and human 
rights were part of the training syllabus. [410-1a][410-1b]
Maintaining a Decent and Safe 
Work Environment Together 
[POJK51-F.21]
Applying one of the sustainable mining principles, 
which is the OHS requirement, PT Vale has 
introduced the Mineral and Coal Mining Safety 
System (SMKP Minerba), according to Minister 
of Energy and Mineral Resources’ Decision No. 
1827/K/30/MEM/2018 concerning Implementing 
Guidelines on Good Mining Practices. OHS 
Management also refers to ISO 45001 Occupational 
Health and Safety Management System. Applying 
one of the sustainable mining principles, which 
is the OHS requirement, PT Vale has introduced 
the Mineral and Coal Mining Safety System 
(SMKP Minerba), according to Minister of Energy 
and Mineral Resources’ Decision No. 1827/K/30/MEM/2018 
concerning Implementing Guidelines on Good Mining Practices. 
We also have a Safe Work Permit (SWP) to ensure that all risks 
and the safety control that must be prepared are identified. 
PT Vale complies with the industrial hygiene requirement, 
including dust, noise, and ergonomics, which are listed in the 
KPIs and reviewed periodically. The OHS requirement includes 
employees, contractors, and vendors. We do not exempt them 
from the requirement, including other stakeholders visiting the 
Company’s premises. [403-1a][403-1b] [403-8a][403-8b][403-8c]
Key Hazard Identification and OHS Training  
The OHS requirement is fulfilled through the identification of key 
hazards, which will be managed using systems and instruments 
inherent to the operational activities, which are the Contractor 
Safety Management System (CSMS), General Induction Program 
(GIP), Site Specific Induction Program (SSIP), Risk Assessment 
(RA), Job Safety Analysis (JSA), Safety Talks, Critical Activity 
Requirements (CAR), SWP, and audits/inspections. In addition, 
PT Vale has mechanisms for employees and workers to report 
conditions that will jeopardize their health and safety at work. 
In 2022, occupational safety monitoring and inspection were 
reported through a smartphone application and a web-based 
CCVV. Furthermore, occupational accidents were reported 
through a smartphone IRIS application. [403-2a][403-2b]
We have the policy to remove employees and workers from 
situations that endanger their health and safety. Employees 
have the right to refuse, terminate, and report work deemed 
unsafe to their superiors. The Company will follow up on the 
reports, including by investigating any incident. PT Vale had 
identified hazards and assessed potential risks, allowing every 
potential risk to be controlled during the reporting period.  
[403-2c][403-2d]
The OHS Central Committee supports activities to ensure 
OHS. In committee meetings, employee representatives may 
report on various OHS-related issues. In 2022, the committee 
organized twelve meetings, the reports submitted during 
which have been followed up by the Company. Employees 
and workers are also involved in ensuring OHS by providing 
them with training, including certification, to improve their 
competence. The training provided includes the safety stand 
down, prevention week, contractor forum, health week, DoR, 
and safety share training. PT Vale organized 21 OHS training 
programs in 2022, attended by 2,214 employees and 18,955 
workers (contractor/vendor). [403-4a] [403-4b][403-5a]
Employee Health 
Activities to ensure employees’ and workers’ 
occupational health in 2022 were still focused on 
addressing the COVID-19 pandemic. We organized 
the third dose COVID-19 vaccination program for 
employees and workers, with 98.8% participation. 
Another effort we made was operationalizing a 
COVID-19 PCR lab in the Enggano Clinic, which 
can examine 200 samples daily. The lab helps 
employees and workers get their swab test results 
on the same day, eliminating any disruption to their 
productivity. The clinic system is also connected to 
the PeduliLindungi application, providing users with 
easy access. PT Vale also monitors employees and 
contractors with comorbidities and encourages them 
to undergo medical check-ups regularly. [403-3a]

PT Vale conducts an OHS compliance audit 
annually, referring to SMKP Minerba and 
the IMS–Environment Health and Safety 
Management System. In 2022, a certified 
auditor carried out the internal SMKP 
Minerba audit. The results indicate 70% 
compliance, lower than in 2021, which was 
75.18%.Safety performance is also monitored 
using statistical calculations, the Severity 
Rate (SR) and Frequency Rate (FR), calculated 
per 1,000,000 working hours. The calculation 
does not exempt certain employees and 
workers and includes mining operations and 
production activities. [403-9a][403-9b][403-9c][403-

The results of OHS performance statistical 
calculation in 2022 were affected by a 
fatal work accident involving a worker 
at PT Multitama Indonesia, a contractor 
or work partner of PT Vale, on October 
21, 2022, at the Delaney Tire Shop, while 
repairing tires for heavy equipment. As 
a follow-up, we temporarily terminated 
activities in all workshops and tire reparation 
activities, reviewed all equipment with a 
potential pressure risk, and coordinated 
and fully cooperated with the authorities 
in the investigation and on the resulting 
recommendations to prevent future 
recurrences.
To improve occupational health and safety, 
the Company made the following efforts in 
2022:  [403-9d]
•	Organizing monthly contactor forums, 
which must be attended by operational 
PICs and company owners
•	Organizing the safety stand down, 
prevention week, health week, and DoR

Social Sustainability Management Performance
In 2022, PT Vale’s social programs 
contributed to the achievement 
of Green PROPER, particularly 
in its community empowerment 
program, and obtained recognition 
from six relevant agencies in 
eight categories, such as the most 
innovative Integrated Community 
Empowerment and Development 
Program in the health sector from 
the Ministry of Energy and Mineral 
Resources, the Indonesian Sustainable 
Development Goals Award from the 
Ministry of National Development 
Planning, and the Sustainable Village 
Development Award from the Ministry 
of Villages, Underdeveloped Area 
Development, and Transmigration.  
As a continuous improvement effort, 
PT Vale has evaluated the management 
of the Integrated Community 
Empowerment and Development 
Program during the review of the 2018-
2022 Indonesian Integrated Community 
Empowerment and Development 
Program document. Together with 
related parties, PT Vale is preparing to 
roll out the 2023 Integrated Community

Building Synergy with the Government
We continuously build synergy with local 
governments and contribute to regional economic 
development. PT Vale transferred the Sorowako 
Airport to the provincial government in the 
reporting period, marked by the signing of a deed 
of release during a special parliamentarian plenary 
of East Luwu on May 12, 2022. South Sulawesi 
Governor Andi Sudirman Sulaiman and PT Vale 
President Director Febriany Eddy signed the deed 
of release. 
Three objects that PT Vale released to the 
provincial government of South Sulawesi were:
•	Land of 25.4 Ha;
•	Movable assets functioning as facilities and 
infrastructure to support the operation of 
Sorowako Airport;
•	Sorowako Airport service management.
The purpose of the transfer was to support 
tourism in South Sulawesi, particularly East 
Luwu. After being managed by the provincial 
government, Sorowako Airport has been serving as 
a public airport, thereby increasing the number of 
tourists visiting the province. Moreover, the airport 
supports the traffic of goods, including exports. 
Program scheme, in line with support to 
achieve SDGs and the self-reliant rural 
development goal. All stakeholders are 
expected to play a role in the community 
development program through a Creating 
Share Value (CSV) scheme to allow the 
local community around the mines and 
the Company to benefit from the added 
value. It is also an advanced milestone in 
preparing post-mining, local-potential-
based community self-sufficiency.
In addition to developing leading 
local commodities, the Company 
also implements educational 
programs, including capacity building, 
vocational training, preventive effort 
reinforcement, community-resourced 
health promotion, and a sustainable 
eco-tourism supporting initiative. 
Therefore, the development can be a 
social innovation to improve the Human 
Development Index and the extractive, 
non-industrial, creative economic sector, 
particularly in East Luwu District.

PT Vale also inked a memorandum of understanding 
(MoU) with the district government of Kolaka to 
implement integrated community empowerment 
and development programs in the district. A number 
of programs have been initiated to implement the 
MoU, including sustainable, eco-friendly, healthy 
farming (PSLRB) through organic rice planting using 
the system of rice intensification (SRI) and local 
capacity building to improve community members’ 
skills in the Pomalaa Block. The Company also gives 
donations and actively promotes improved facilities 
and infrastructure in the empowerment areas.
The Bahodopi Block, in collaboration with the 
provincial government of Central Sulawesi, 
is building a water treatment installation 
in Watutela, Tondo, to help meet the clean 
water needs of the survivors of the natural 
disaster that struck Palu in 2018. The Rp4 
billion installation will provide 10 liters of 
water per second and will be equipped with 
a reservoir with a capacity of 100,000 liters. 
As of December 2022, the water treatment 
installation has been 79% built. 
In this block, PT Vale has also built synergy 
with the district government of Morowali 
through a program to improve service facilities 
and infrastructure in the Bahomotefe health 
center, East Bungku Sub-district. This 
program is PT Vale’s contribution to improving 
healthcare for the surrounding communities. 
Renovation reached 70% as of December 2022.
Furthermore, PT Vale donated two 
ambulances to the district government of 
Morowali at the end of 2022 to support 
optimized healthcare provision in the 
Bahomotefe health center, East Bungku sub-
district, and the Bahodopi health center, 
Bahodopi Sub-district, Morowali District.
The health-sector capacity-
building program was also 
implemented, in collaboration 
with the district Health Office 
of Morowali, through training 
of food handlers, such as food 
business owners/actors, health 
personnel at health centers, 
and family welfare program 
participants, in hygiene and 
sanitation. 
To optimize the absorption of the local workforce in the empowerment 
areas, PT Vale, in collaboration with the Sorowako Academy of Engineering 
(ATS), held basic certification training in electricity and welding for eight 
weeks, attended by 52 participants living in 13 villages in the empowerment 
areas in East Bungku and Bahodopi Sub-districts.

Social Sustainability Management Performance
In order to improve the community’s economy, PT Vale 
conducted PSRLB through the Organic SRI method 
in several empowerment areas, including Mahalona 
Raya, Towuti District, East Luwu, with a total land 
area of 20 hectares. At the beginning of 2022 PSRLB 
managed by the Harapan Mulya Farmers Group in the 
Libuk Mandiri Village. It carried out a grand harvest 
of the Mentik Susu variety of rice. This is the 12th 
harvest since the implementation of PSRLB, with an 
average production of 7.8 tons of grain per hectare 
and has the potential to increase farmers’ income. 
PSRLB has received INOFICE certification which is 
accepted by assisted farmers, and is able to save costs 
on fertilizer consumption as well as pesticides. PT Vale 
also provided facilities and infrastructure to support 
agricultural management efficiency. To optimize 
absorption, we intensified cooperation in marketing 
Organic SRI rice, including through employee catering..
PT Vale helped build classrooms for 
Islamic Elementary School Al-Khairaat 
in Kolono Village, East Bungku Sub-
district, Morowali District, Central 
Sulawesi, scheduled to be completed

educational human resources capacity 
in Morowali District.
PT Vale facilitated the construction of the 
first pole for tourist boat mooring at the 
Laa Waa River Park in Matano Village, East 
Luwu. The river park is a tourist destination 
expected to be a new economic source

Village is in the top 50 villages to receive the 
Indonesian Tourism Village Award (ADWI) 
from the Ministry of Tourism and Creative 
Economy. Lake Matano is also the world’s 8th 
deepest lake, attracting tourists.

Grievance Response and 
Handling [POJK51-F.24] [413-1a][MM7]  
PT Vale provides access for the public to 
voice their complaints and grievances, 
including monthly sub-district coordination 
meetings. In addition, we devise a Stakeholder, 
Demands and Issues (SDI) application to 
handle complaints and allegations. All 
information received is recorded and reviewed 
though the application used to support the 
management of information from the public 
and other institutions and consolidated in 
the Company’s social performance in 2022.
Each complaint or allegation will be followed 
up by the External Relations Department 
using different approaches based on the 
type of communications (i.e., allegations, 
complaints, information, requests, and 
compliments) and involving relevant parties. 
Throughout 2022, 697 communication pieces 
were received in the Sorowako Block, 120 
of which were considered allegations and 
complaints in five categories: job opportunities, 
land acquisition conflicts, compensation, 
access roads, and social project support. In 
the Bahodopi Block, three complaints and 
allegations were received during the reporting 
period. We responded to them using different 
approaches to find the best solutions.

Social Sustainability Management Performance
PT Vale also periodically evaluates 
suppliers’ and work partners’ 
performance with potential social 
impacts on the local communities when 
evaluating environmental management 
performance. Throughout 2022 we 
evaluate all (100%) new suppliers/
partners. Based on the evaluation 
conducted, there was no termination 
of the work contract with the supplier/
work partner because they did not 
manage socially according to PT Vale’s 
regulations and standards. [414-1a][414-2a]

Indonesia Tbk. [2-9a][2-9b][2-9c][2-10a][2-10b][2-15a][2-15b]
Sustainability governance implementation is the 
collective responsibility of the directors, under the 
coordination of the President Director, who is also 
the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) as the highest-
ranking officer of sustainability governance. The 
directors implement sustainability governance 
based on Vale’s 2030 Commitment, structured as 
key performance indicators covering the economic, 
environmental, social, and governance aspects. KPI 
achievement is evaluated regularly and reported to 
shareholders. [POJK51-E.1] [2-11a][2-11b][2-12a][2-12b] [2-12c]

Evaluating Sustainability Risk 
Management  [POJK51-E.3]
Sustainability performance risks are managed 
using a risk management system that takes 
into account ISO 31000:2018, ISO 55001:2014, 
and COSO-ERM on Risk Management and Asset 
Management. Risk management is carried 
out by the Board of Directors, assisted by 
implementing functions in the management,

and the Internal Audit, and supervised by the 
Board of Commissioners, assisted by the Risk 
Mitigation Committee. Risk management is 
evaluated in directors’ and commissioners’ 
meetings. Risk management evaluation in 2022 
found that the sustainability performance risk 
management was effective.  
To mitigate risks, PT Vale always involves the 
communities in the early stages of all activities. 
No work was postponed for community rejection 
or other non-technical reasons in 2022. It 
confirms that PT Vale carries out all operational 
activities responsibly by considering the 
communities. [EM-MM-210b.2]

Anti-Corruption Support [EM-MM-510a.1]
We have zero tolerance for corruption and power abuse 
for personal gains, as indicated in the signing of the anti-
corruption policy by the President Director in 2015. 
Together with the Hadiputranto Hadinoto & Partners 
Law Firm, the Company identified its corruption risks. We 
put e-procurement into practice to minimize the risk of 
corruption and ensure transparency in contract management. 
We also include anti-bribery and anti-corruption clauses in 
agreements and contracts with third parties. Other measures 
we have taken are to make the Global Vale Anti-corruption 
Guidelines available intranet and provide different channels 
for stakeholders to give information or report on any 
violation or indication of corruption. [205-1a][205-1b] 
PT Vale regularly organizes refresher training for directors 
and other company officials on compliance with the Code 
of Conduct. Throughout 2022, we communicated and 
campaigned for anti-corruption to employees though 
email blasts and banners. We also communicated PT 
Vale’s Code of Conduct for Suppliers to 24,494 suppliers 
and organized the following anti-corruption training 
programs: [205-2a][205-2b][205-2c][205-2d][205-2e]
•	Anti-Corruption 2022 training online;
•	2022 Priority Area Anti-Corruption Training online;
•	2022 New Employee Anti-Corruption Training online;

PT Vale never received allegations of corruption against 
employees or work partners during the reporting period. 
We never had any criminal case of alleged corruption 
involving the Company either. [205-3a] [205-3b][205-3c]
Constraints and Challenges in 
Implementing Sustainability [POJK51-E.5]
Stakeholders’ different perceptions and interests 
can become constraints and challenges in delivering 
sustainability performance, particularly in the 
environmental and social aspects. Another constraint 
is negative impact management, which requires a lot 
of measurement and documentation, while PT Vale 
has limitations in applying all the calculation methods. 
Two continuously pursued solutions are intensifying 
communications and training and monitoring the recording 
of calculation data as a basis for performance evaluation. 
In addition, for the decarbonization aspect, the main 
challenges are the available technology, the availability of 
low-carbon fuel and its supporting infrastructure, as well 
as investment costs and time for construction.

Building the Nation Together
PT Vale recorded a positive performance in 2022, 
despite facing the COVID-19 pandemic and unrecovered 
national and global economies. This achievement can be 
attributed to its various efforts, including implementing 
the Vale Production System (VPS) and developing 
sustainable innovations. 
Economic Value Generated and Distributed 
Information on economic value generated and 
distributed is presented on a cash basis based on 
audited financial statements. Information disclosed is 
as recommended by the GRI Standards. Therefore, the 
figures presented may differ from the audited financial 
statements. During 2022 we were able to optimize the 
generated economic value of US$1.2 billion, an increase 
of 24.5% from 2021 which reached US$955.9 million. 
A portion of the generated economic value has been 
distributed to stakeholders. [201-1a]
One of the factors affecting economic performance in 
2022 was controlling production costs to US$11,444 per 
ton of nickel in matte, an increase from US$8,430 per ton 
in 2021. The Company did not receive financial aid from 
the Government of Indonesia. However, looking at the 
share ownership structure, the Government indirectly 
owns the Company’s shares through the ownership of 
MIND.ID, which has  been one of PT Vale’s shareholders 
since 2020. [201-1b][201-4a][201-4b] [201-4c]
Production and Sale Target and Realization  [POJK51-F.2]
During the reporting period, we faced the phenomenon of climate change 
such as weather anomalies, the irregular weather conditions, which 
affected nickel ore mining operations, as well as delivery of matte nickel 
to buyers. This has an impact on PT Vale’s finances, there was an increase 
in the of operational expenses. Nonetheless, the Company was able to 
meet its nickel ore and nickel in matte production targets and sales to 
customers. [201-2a]

applicable tax regulations in Indonesia. The policy, 
management, and supervision of the Company’s taxes and 
PNBP are the responsibility of the Tax Section in the Finance 
Department and are directly supervised by the Director 
of Finance and then reported to Vale Canada to the Vice 
President of Tax Base Metal and Vale Brazil. Reporting is 
carried out every month and every quarter. We coordinated 
and consulted with the local Tax Service Office, to ensure 
the level of compliance with obligations and taxpayers, both 
entities and individuals. PT Vale also supports transparency 
and contributes to Indonesia’s EITI reporting. [207-1][207-2] [207-3]
This report discloses taxes and non-tax state revenue 
levies paid only to the Government of Indonesia, which 
comprises the national and local governments, given that 
PT Vale operates only in Indonesia. Overall in 2022, we paid 
US$179,000 thousand in taxes and non-tax state revenue 
levies to the Government of Indonesia. This amount is an 
increase of 58% from US$113,080 thousand in 2021.  This

Affirming our commitment to implementing sustainability governance, we have the

Customer Equality [POJK51-F.17]
Based on the agreed long-term contracts, 80% 
and 20% of PT Vale’s nickel in matte products 
must be sold to Vale Canada Limited (VCL) 
and Sumitomo Metal Mining Co.Ltd (SMM), 
respectively. We do not face market competition 
with similar businesses. We serve our buyers 
equally, including in setting selling prices that 
refer to the London Metal Exchange. [206-1a][206-1b]
 Influence on the Communities
PT Vale indirectly benefits the local communities 
through the utilization of the Company’s 
operational infrastructure by the local 
communities: [203-1a][203-1b][203-1c]
•	A 64-kilometer road from Sorowako to Malili 
built for PT Vale’s logistic unit can freely be used 
by the local community as the main access for 
land transportation to support people’s and 
commodities’ mobilities.  
•	Dam construction and hydropower operation. 
PT Vale supplies 10.7 MW of electricity to PT PLN 
(Persero) locally to meet the local community’s 
need for electricity in exchange for payments 
at the government price. The electricity supply 
supports the local community’s productive 
activities.
Another indirect benefit is employment opportunities at 
local contractors and suppliers in the Company’s supply 
chain. We define local companies as businesses located 
and/or operating in East Luwu District. The workers 
will receive employment benefits that they will be able 
to spend on their subsistence needs, thereby having a 
butterfly effect on the local economy. As of December 
31, 2022, 301 local companies, or 11% of the total vendors/
suppliers, became part of PT Vale’s supply chain. Some 
are vendors/suppliers for the development projects in 
Bahodopi and Pomalaa. We are also currently conducting 
an SII study related to how PT Vale’s business encourages 
the growth of other economic sectors, with the results 
of the study to be presented in 2023. [203-2a][203-2b][204-1a]

Responsibility for Product/
Service Development
Innovation and Product/Service 
Development [POJK51-F.26]
During the reporting period, PT Vale did 
not innovate and diversify nickel in matte 
products. However, for business development, 
we will develop products that will support the 
energy transition in the coming years. Those 
products are:
•	Mixed Hydroxide Precipitate (MHP), which will 
be produced by limonite nickel purification and 
processing plants in the Sorowako Limonite 
and Pomalaa projects. MHP production is 
scheduled to begin in 2026 with a projected 
total capacity of 60 kilotons per year in 
Sorowako and 120 thousand tons in Pomalaa; 
•	Nickel in ferronickel, which will be produced by 
a nickel ore processing plant in the Bahodopi 
project starting in 2025. The total production 
capacity will be between 73 and 80 kilotons of 
ferronickel per year.
Product Safety and Impact Management  
[POJK51-F.27] [POJK51-F.28]
PT Vale’s nickel in matte production and the products 
comply with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances 
(RoHS) standards and ISO 17025:2008 certification. 
Nickel in matte is an intermediate product used as a raw 
material in further processing by buyers without directly 
impacting the buyers or the environment. The Company 
never received any complaints about the impacts of the 
products on employees’, workers’ and buyers’ health and 
safety during the reporting period. [416-1a] [416-2a][416-2b]
Product Withdrawals and Customer 
Satisfaction [POJK51-F.29] [POJK51-F.30]
No products were withdrawn at buyers’ request in 2022. 
Nickel in matte is transported to buyers in a 3.3-ton 
special package. Information labels on origin, product 
specifications, and handling instructions are affixed outside 
the package. PT Vale evaluated all its products to see their 
compliance with labelling procedures. There were never any 
complaints from buyers about information discrepancies 
on the labels. We were never fined or legally sanctioned for 
alleged non-compliance with marketing communication 
regulations. [417-1a][417-1b][417-2a] [417-2b][417-3a][417-3c]
We always maintain the quality of products and services 
to buyers. PT Vale’s customers have a long-term contracts, 
therefore there is no customer satisfaction survey. 
However, PT Vale and customers routinely hold monthly 
meetings regarding the performance and if problems 
found they will be followed up at these meetings. 
We ensure that the data of buyers is stored safely. We 
use a security system to protect data from corruption, 
modification, and unauthorized dissemination. With 
that security system, the data can only be accessed by 
those authorized by the management. No buyers made 
allegations about data corruption, data modification, or 
data leakages in 2022. [418-1a][418-1b][418-1c]
