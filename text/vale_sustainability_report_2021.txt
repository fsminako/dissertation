Our Commitment 
to Energy Transition
Our Commitment to 
Village Empowerment
Our Commitment 
to Gender Equality
For 53 Years, We Have Been Operating 
In Our Motherland, Indonesia
From the beginning we have 
used sustainable mining 
practices, and energy transition. 
The Company operates three 
Hydroelectric Power Plants 
(PLTA) with a total capacity 
of 365 Megawatts, which 
are capable of avoiding CO2 
emissions by more than 1 
million tons of CO2eq per year 
compared to coal-fired plants.
During our operational 
activities, we pay attention to 
balancing the economic, social 
and environmental aspects. 
Despite it promising a profit 
of US$40 million per year, we 
decided to cancel our coal 
conversion project, as it would 
have increased emissions by 
200 thousand tons of CO2eq 
per year. Instead, we plan to 
build a processing plant in 
Bahodopi in Central Sulawesi 
using natural gas as an energy 
source. We have signed the 
Bahodopi Nickel Processing 
Facility Project Cooperation 
Framework Agreement (PCFA). 
The plant in Bahodopi will be 
a nickel processing plant with 
the lowest carbon emissions 
per tonne of nickel after 
Sorowako, South Sulawesi.
We continue to be committed 
and carry out progressive 
reclamation of post-mining  
land and plant more trees to 
minimize the impact of mining 
activities and maximize the use 
of overburden and topsoil to 
support successful reclamation. 
A nursery facility supports this 
reclamation program on 2.5 
ha in Sorowako. This nursery 
facility can produce 700,000 
seedlings per year, which 
exceeds the company’s needs, 
so the excess is channeled to the 
government and the community 
to support environmental 
conservation efforts.  
We Build the Self-Reliance of 
The Indonesian Community
Through the Community 
Empowerment and 
Development Program (PPM), 
by following a Self Reliance 
Rural Area Development 
(PKPM) approach, we 
continue to develop 
villages together with the 
surrounding communities.
The synergy and cooperation 
is carried out following the 
signing of a Memorandum 
of Understanding 
with the Ministry of 
Village, Development of 
Disadvantaged Regions and 
Transmigration (PDTT), as 
well as other stakeholders 
to optimize PPM and PKPM. 
Implementation of the 
consultation is based on 
the procedure. There are 10 
development areas in the 
Nuha, Towuti, Wasuponda 
and Malili sub-districts 
in East Luwu Regency, 
South Sulawesi. These 
areas are used for tourism, 
integrated agriculture 
(agropolitan), pepper 
plantations, and others.
We Respect Human Rights by Implementing 
A Commitment to Gender Equality
At the Annual General 
Meeting of Shareholders 
(AGMS) on April 29, 2021, 
the shareholders appointed 
Febriany Eddy as CEO and 
President Director of PT 
Vale. This confirms PT 
Vale’s strong commitment 
to proportional gender 
diversity, by placing female 
employees in various 
positions.
Although there is only 
one woman at the Board 
of Directors level, the 
position of Febriany Eddy 
has a very strategic role. 
The appointment of 
Febriany Eddy was not only 
meaningful for PT Vale, 
within the scope of national 
gender equality, but her 
presence at the top of PT 
Vale’s leadership was also 
a monumental milestone 
in empowering women in 
the Indonesian extractive 
industry. Based on the 
2020 National Labor Force 
Survey, the proportion 
of female workers in the 
extractive sector was only 
8.14%. Therefore, we will 
continue to provide equal 
opportunities for female 
workers in PT Vale.

Employees 
[POJK51-3.c.2]
Throughout 2021, we did not 
lay off any employees (PHK) 
even though the challenges and 
business conditions were very 
dynamic during the COVID-19 
pandemic. On the other hand, 
PT Vale recruited 89 new 
employees. All of them work 
in Indonesia, with placements 
in South Sulawesi, Central 
Sulawesi, Southeast Sulawesi,  
and outside Sulawesi. In line 
with our management policy, 
the Company does not employ 
part-time employees.

of PT Vale until 2021 is 2,966

We would like to thank you for the input on the 2020 
Sustainability Report received from stakeholders, 
especially from investors. They asked various 
questions about PT Vale’s initiatives in managing the 
environment, especially in supporting the reduction 
of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In response to the 
questions, in this report PT Vale provides information 
on environmental initiatives, beyond compliance with 
environmental regulations, as well as commitments to 
upholding human rights.
The responses to the verification process (assurance) in 
the 2020 report is also one of our concerns, especially 
in completing the quantitative data and supporting 
documentary evidence, and the mapping of material 
topics we have carried out with internal and external 
parties participation. We present the results of material 
topics mapping and significant issues in this report 
along with all the  processes we developed as part of our 
improvement strategy.

About Sustainability Report
Specific Approach to Stakeholders: 
Collective Labor Agreement
Our employees are strategic stakeholders that 
directly affect the Company’s sustainability. 
We do not employ child employees or 
forced labor. During 2021 there were no 
discriminatory practices against employees. 
In 2021 there were no discriminatory practices 
against employees. All (100%) employees are 
protected by a collective labor agreement 
(PKB) by Law No. 13 of 2003 concerning 
Manpower and Law no. 11 of 2020 concerning 
Job Creation. The foreign employees 
(foreigners) regulations are not covered by the 
PKB but by the senior management book. In 
addition, we also evaluate the assessment of 
suppliers/contractors, including those related 
to compliance with the Manpower Act and 
respect for human rights. During the reporting 
period, PT Vale has a freedom of association 
policy set out in the Policy Regular Review.

[POJK51-6.c.2.a] [EM-MM-310a.1]
Material Topics
The process for determining material topics for internal 
stakeholders is different this year than in previous years. 
This year, the material topics were determined using 
various methods that involved internal and external  
stakeholders.
Internal stakeholders:
1. 	Management - from FGD
2. 	
 Employees - from employee survey
External stakeholders:
1.	 Public - from public survey
2.	Media - from Sprinklr Media Monitoring tools 
3.	Local stakeholders - from sample survey.  
This approach is also used in discussions facilitated by 
independent parties, acting as a team of experts. The 
discussion discussed the actual and potential impacts, 
both positive and negative, from the Company’s 
activities, together with an analysis of their effect. [3-1a]  
[3-1b] [POJK51-5.d.1] [POJK51-5.d.2]
The discussions resulted in ten material topics based 
on sustainability and aligned with efforts to achieve 
the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). There is 
an additional material topic ‘Equality and Diversity’ 
in the 2021 report. This is in line with the Company’s 
commitment to promote equality and diversity, without 
discrimination, whilst acknowledging existing historical 
and cultural obligations. [3-2a][3-2b]

Pillar Goals
Serving society, 
giving back to all
Serving the communities by 
contributing to all	
From

served the communities. 
Turning natural resources

areas, contributing to 
the development of the 
country. Currently PT Vale 
serves the communities 
by providing what they 
need and want, including 
mining materials and other 
resources to improve

Creating prosperity for all.
Doing it together
Doing together means 
listening but our listening 
will only be valuable if it is 
comprehensive. Everyone 
must listen: society, 
governments, customers, and 
especially the people who 
make PT Vale, everywhere PT 
Vale is. After all, we are the 
communities. Communities 
are PT Vale.
Doing together means 
creating a collective capacity 
to think, design and realize 
possible futures for everyone.

Creating spaces dialogues that 
evolve the industry as a whole.
Doing together means 
acting with responsibility,

do something 
extraordinary.
All mining companies 
are required to preserve 
nature, protect the

involved in the company’s 
operations.
Transforming the future 
by taking care of the 
present.	
We are generating development for 
communities, well-being for society and 
permanent environmental preservation 
mechanisms. Leaving the world a better 
place than when Vale arrived. Putting 
the benefits intrinsic to mining at the 
service of society as a whole.
But also: using the knowledge and 
technical, human, financial and catalytic 
capacity that PT Vale has developed 
over the years to rebuild a virtuous 
cycle of prosperity that points to an 
inclusive and comprehensive future, in 
which everyone benefits and PT Vale’s 
horizons expand to meet the needs of a 
world in constant transformation.
Recognizing the role of natural 
resources, but also humanity’s infinite 
vocation to create and evolve.
Focus for the Future

During its 53 years of operations in Indonesia, 
PT Vale has been committed to implementing 
sustainable mining practices. We realize this 
commitment by supporting external initiatives 
through the Sustainable Mining Management 
Principles based on the International Council 
of Mining and Metals (ICMM) Framework. 
In 2021, we instigated five environmental 
commitments to support the achievement of 
net zero carbon emissions. [2-25]
The Company is committed to and continues 
to strive to comply with all applicable 
environmental regulations, including by 
using an application, namely the Regulation 
Compliance System (RCS), and referring 
to Global standards related to regulation 
compliance which allows the company to 
access and identify its compliance at any 
time with the obligations of the applicable 
regulations. In addition, the Company 
cooperates with Bureau Veritas as an external 
auditor to evaluate PT Vale’s environmental 
performance.
Furthermore, PT Vale will continue to make 
regular efforts to report on performance 
and environmental issues regularly since the 
start of operations through Environmental

Management of 
Material Topics 
Mining activities can have 
an unavoidable negative 
impact on the environment. 
However, we continue to strive 
to manage these impacts so 
the environmental pollution 
does not occur. Environmental 
management is confirmed 
to reduce by various policies, 
targets, and initiatives. To 
ensure their implementation, 
the Environment and Permit 
Management (EPM) department 
conducts monitoring, reporting 
and auditing, and the results 
are submitted to the relevant 
institutions to ensure 
environmental compliance. Our 
environmental performance is 
shown below. [EM-MM-160a.1]
PT Vale continues to strive 
for 33% scope 1 and 2 
greenhouse gas emissions 
by 2030 by implementing 
various programs, including:
PT Vale was one of the 
participants at the 26th 
Conference of Parties (COP) in 
Glasgow, Scotland, which was 
attended by 197 countries. 
Our presence at COP 26 shows 
our primary commitment to 
addressing climate change, 
and was also an opportunity 
to share information about PT 
Vale’s initiatives to reducing 
and neutralizing GHG 
emissions.
During the forum, 
Febriany Eddy as CEO 
of PT Vale, shared the 
initiatives, experiences, 
and achievements in the 
transition to environmentally 
friendly energy process by 
emphasizing sustainability 
as a core governance in the 
mining industry. PT Vale’s 
energy transition efforts 
include operating three 
hydroelectric power plants 
that reduce GHG emissions by 
more than 1 million tons CO2eq 
per year, and the cancellation 
of a coal conversion 
project to reduce potential 
additional carbon emissions 
of 200,000 tons CO2eq per 
year. We are also committed 
to the rehabilitation and 
conservation of biodiversity 
on post-mining land. [3-3a][3-3b]

PT Vale’s Contribution to the Planet
PT Vale’s climate change 
risk management focuses 
on sustainability and we 
refer to the Task Force on 
Climate-Related Financial 
Disclosure (TCFD) guidelines. 
We have set short term 
targets for energy efficiency 
solutions and for maximizing 
renewable energy usage; 
while the medium-term 
target for 2030 is a 33% 
reduction in absolute scope 
1 and scope 2 emissions. 
The long-term target is to 
achieve net zero emissions 
by 2050. [EM-MM-110a.2] [TCFD 
Strategi.a]
We believe that in the 
future, the energy transition 
will be one of the keys 
to ensuring the success 
of controlling climate 
change, and preventing a 
2oC temperature increase 
according to the Paris 
Agreement. Along with this, 
nickel, which is a product 
of PT Vale, will become an 
important commodity in the 
energy transition to build 
the required renewable 
infrastructure, and support 
transporting electrification 
via electric vehicles (EV). 
The increasing demand 
for nickel will affect the 
Company’s positive financial 
performance in the next 
few years. [TCFD Strategy.b] [TCFD

GHG Emission Calculations [POJK51-6.e.4.a]
The calculations include GHG scope 1 emissions in the 
production and usage of fuel oil (BBM), and scope 2 in 
electricity usage. The GHG emissions results are expressed 
as total emissions, in units of tons of CO2equivalent (CO2eq), 
including the conversion of non-CO2 GHG emissions (CH4, 
N2O, dan HFC). The calculations use the energy consumption 
balance method for fossil fuels and gases that cause the 
greenhouse effect using a 2017 baseline, and the Global 
Warming Potential/GWP=1 index. There are no calculations 
for biogenic CO2 emissions. All GHG emission calculations 
are for operations in Sorowako, South Sulawesi. The 
calculation of GHG emissions uses the Intergovernmental 
Panel on Climate Change (PCC) guidelines with the Global 
Warming Potential (GWP) index, which refers to the fifth 
report assessment in 2014 (AR-5). [305-1a, 305-2a][305-1b][305-2c]
[305-2b][305-1c][305-1d][305-2d][305-1e, 305-2e][305-1f, 305-2f][305-1g, 305-2g] 
During the reporting period PT Vale did not calculate 
scope 3 emissions. PT Vale is gradually trying to reduce 
GHG emissions in its supply chain activities by encouraging 
suppliers and customers to share its commitment to 
reduce carbon emissions in all activities carried out. [305-3]
GHG Emissions Intensity  [POJK51-6.e.4.a]
GHG Emissions Intensity only calculates carbon equivalent 
emissions (CO2eq), including CH4, N2O, and HFC, based on 
the total GHG scope 1 and scope 2 emission calculation. 
The results are expressed in tons of CO2eq /ton Ni, 
using the calculation of  Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change (IPCC) method. [305-4b][305-4c][305-4d]
The GHG emission intensity in 2021 was 28.6 tons CO2eq/
ton Ni, an increase of 2% from 27.91 tons CO2eq/ton Ni 
in 2020. This was due to a decrease in the total nickel 
in matte production and the consumption of lower 
nickel content ore when compared to 2020. [305-4a]
GHG Emissions Reduction  [POJK51-6.e.4.b]
The GHG emissions reduction came from the hydroelectric power 
operations, which reduced additional carbon scope 1 emissions by 1,118,231 
tons of CO2eq per year, for diesel power plants (PLTD) using fuel (BBM); and 
by 2,292,375 tons of CO2eq per year, for steam power plants (PLTU) using 
coal. Overall in 2021, we succeeded in reducing GHG emissions by 147,705 tons 
CO2eq, or by 7% of GHG emissions in 2020 by, or up to 7.7% of the 2017 GHG 
emission baseline of 155,948 tons CO2eq. [305-5a] [305-5b] [305-5c] [305-5e]
We continue to seek opportunities to reduce GHG emissions in the 
production processes, to reduce GHG emissions of 1,800 kilotons CO2eq, or 
90% of total GHG emissions. Other opportunities exist in the mining areas 
for a GHG emission reduction of 200 kilotons CO2eq.

Emissions Containing Ozone 
Depleting Substances (ODS)
PT Vale no longer uses HCF-22 (CHF2Cl) freon by 
replacing it with R32 freon, a non-ozone depleting 
substance, as it has an Ozone Depletion Potential 
(ODP) value of 0, and a Global Warming Potential 
(GWP) value of 675. All R32 freon is purchased 
from suppliers, and we have not calculated the 
volume of freon R32 used, so this report does not 
include an explanation on the methodology or 
calculation results. [305-6a][305-6b][305-6c][305-6d]
SO2 and Particulate Emissions Control 
[POJK51-6.e.4.a] [EM-MM-120a.1]
SO2 emissions result from the use of sulfur to sulfidation in the 
nickel ore processing that uses High Sulfur Fuel Oil (HSFO) and 
coal. We continue to work to ensure the SO2 emissions meets 
the Government’s quality standards, based on 2014 Minister of 
the Environment Regulation No. 4 concerning Fixed Emissions 
Quality Standards for Mining Business and/or Activities.
PT Vale periodically monitors and calculates the amount of 
SO2 emissions intensity. The calculation uses the mass balance 
method by determining the intensity of emissions by comparing 
the weight of SO2 emitted with the weight of the product 
produced. The calculation of SO2 emissions is expressed in 
units of Ton SO2/Ton Ni. The results of the calculation of SO2 
emission levels always meet the quality standard threshold 
of 0.80 Ton SO2/Ton Ni. However, PT Vale is committed to 
reducing SO2 emissions by continuing to conduct studies 
involving experts from academia and practitioners. Studies to 
reduce SO2 emissions are focused on increasing the efficiency 
of sulfur fixation in the sulfidation process in a reducing 
furnace, including process control and sulfur injection methods. 
The trend of decreasing nickel content from mining is one of 
the challenges to reducing the intensity of SO2 emissions.
During 2021, PT Vale instigated SO2 emission controls, 
including stabilizing the process in the reduction kilns 
that affects the liquid sulfur usage; converting of the 
use of Marine Fuel Oil (MFO) to lower sulfur coal in drying 
kilns and reduction kilns no. 2 and 3; and converting 
conventional diesel to B20 diesel with a lower sulfur content 
in biodiesel than conventional diesel. [POJK51-6.e.4.b]
Particulate Intensity measurements are carried out according to USEPA Method 
5, and are expressed in Tons of Particulates/Tons of Ni. Particulate emissions are 
derived from the results of periodic measurements of the dryer kiln, reduction kiln, 
electric furnace and product dryer chimneys. The particulate quality standard value 
is 0.80 Ton Particulate/Ton Ni, and the particulate concentrate measurement result 
during 2021 was 0.020 Ton Particulate/Ton Ni, meeting the quality standard.

About Vale Power Shift (VPS) [POJK51-6.d.3]
To support the transition to a future low-carbon economy, PT Vale 
follows the Vale Global internal program: Vale Power Shift (VPS). 
This program aims to improve PT Vale’s energy matrix by focusing 
on the use of renewable energy and alternative fuels, as well as 
efficiencies by using new technologies. Initiatives related to VPS 
are expected to contribute around 5% of the planned reduction by 
2030. The Debottlenecking project was implemented in 2021 and is 
targeted for completion in 2024.
In 2021, PT Vale together with two partner companies, Taiyuan 
Iron & Steel (Group) Co., Ltd (TISCO) and Shandong Xinhai 
Technology Co., Ltd (Xinhai), signed the Bahodopi Nickel Processing 
Facility Project Cooperation Framework Agreement (PCFA). This 
cooperation includes the construction of a nickel processing facility 
in the Xinhai Industrial Park, Morowali, Central Sulawesi. Through 
this collaboration, eight ferronickel processing lines using Rotary 
Kiln Electric Furnace (RKEF) technology will be built with an 
estimated production of 73,000 metric tons of nickel/year, 
together with supporting facilities. All parties agreed that the 
processing facilities’ electricity needs would be sourced from 
the Gas Power Plant (PLTG) further supporting the commitment 
to reduce carbon emissions.
Energy Usage and Efficiency
Energy usage calculations include the volume of energy sources 
used within the company for heavy equipment operations in 
nickel ore mining operations and nickel in matte production 
processes. We have not calculated the energy consumption 
outside the Company. The energy sources come from 
hydroelectric power  supply, which includes renewable energy, 
as well as thermal power generation and fossil fuels, which are 
non-renewable energy. None of the hydroelectric power plant 
electricity is sold to other parties. The energy usage calculation 
uses the sum method for the volume of energy sources used, 
which is converted into Gigajoules (GJ) using the International 
Energy Agency (IEA) conversion. [302-1a][302-1b][302-1e][302-1f][302-1g]
[302-2][POJK51-6.d.3.a]
Total energy usage in 2021 was 28,268,297 GJ, down 10% from 
30,628,679 GJ in 2020. The largest energy source is from coal 
usage of 9,340,201 GJ, a decrease of 22% from 11,371,381 GJ 
in 2020. PT Vale also used 28,268,297 GJ of renewable energy 
sourced from hydroelectric power or 32.2% and the remaining 
67.8 came from non-renewable energy. [302-1a][302-1b][302-1e] [EM-

Energy Intensity
Energy intensity is calculated as the total electricity and fuel 
energy required to produce one tonne of nickel in matte. 
The calculation does not include energy usage outside the 
Company. The Energy Intensity in 2021 was 432.31 GJ/Ton Ni, 
higher than 424.00 GJ/Ton Ni in 2020. [302-3a][302-3b][302-3c][302-3d]
[POJK51-6.d.3.a]
Energy Usage Reduction 
Total energy costs in 2021 accounted about US$639,352 million 
of nickel in matte production costs, an increase from 31.6% in 
2020. This increase was due to increased fuel and coal prices, of 
12% for HSFO, 13% for HSD, and 29% for coal, respectively.
By comparing the volume of energy sources used, during 
2021, we can reduce fuel consumption. The volume of MFO 
usage in 2021 will reach 205 million liters, down 1.5% from 
2020 of 208 million liters; while the use of HSD in 2021 will get 
69 million liters, or down 10% from 2020 of 77 million liters. 
Coal consumption in 2021 also decreased by 12% to 374,937 
tons, from the previous 426,450 tons, in line with the increase 
in nickel in matte production and offset the decrease in fuel 
consumption. [302-4a][302-4b][302-4c][302-4d]
We continue to encourage energy efficiency through several 
efforts, including biofuel (BBN) biodiesel which is more 
environmentally friendly because it contains 30% Fatty 
Acid Methyl Ester (FAME). Biodiesel is used for operational 
vehicles. The volume of biodiesel use in 2021 reaching 69.48 
million liters, or 25% of the total fuel consumption, and will 
decrease by 77.17 million liters in 2020. [POJK51-6.d.3.b]
This report has not calculated the energy demand reduction/
efficiency from products/services sold during 2021, as the 
delivery of nickel in matte to customers uses vessels provided 
by customers, so the energy calculation is based on the fuel 
usage volume conversion. In the future, PT Vale will consider 
requesting this calculation be a joint effort to improve energy 
efficiencies. [302-5a][302-5b][302-5c] 
Support for energy optimization involved replacing the 
transformer at PLTA Larona LGS #1, as the old transformer 
had been used since the Larona hydroelectric power plant 
was first inaugurated in 1978. The replacement transformer 
will increase the reliability of the electricity supply needed to 
support PT Vale’s nickel processing. The new transformer has a 
power of 100 MVA, an increase from the previous transformer 
(78 MVA). This power increase was carried out to adjust to the 
previously increased generating capacity, as well as to provide 
an adequate loading factor for the new transformer.
Contribution to the Development of 
New and Renewable Energy (NRE)
PT Vale also supports the transition to the use of EBT. The 
development of NRE for nickel products will support the 
transition to a low-carbon economy through the production 
of electric car batteries in the future. PT Vale is focused on 
realizing strategic plans for the next five years, including 
preparing a smelter plant or nickel processing in Bahodopi, 
Central Sulawesi, and in Pomalaa, Southeast Sulawesi. These 
factories will produce Mix Hydroxide Precipitate (MHP) and 
Mix Sulphide Precipitate (MSP) as raw materials for battery 
components in electric vehicles. [POJK51-6.d.3.b]

Management of 
Material Topics
Any negative impact from the mining processes is 
managed through the post-mining plans. We are trying 
to rehabilitate post-mining and cross-border land in 
other areas, especially on critical land. PT Vale continues 
to carry out post-mining rehabilitation and has planted 
more trees from its 2.5 ha nursery in Sorowako, which 
has a capacity of producing 700,000 seedlings per year. 
Reclamation activities are monitored using a reporting 
mechanism to the authorities, and when reclaimed land 
is handed back to the Government, and are evaluated 
for achievement of the Department of Environment and 
Permit Management (EPM) key performance indicators 
(KPI), as the party in charge of the activity. Post-mining 
rehabilitation land in 2021 reached 283.74 ha, 1.3% more 
than planned, resulting in a cumulative total of 3,249.11 
ha. Apart from our employees, the reclamation activities 
also involves other stakeholders, including the central 
government’s Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources 
(ESDM) and Ministry of Environment and Forestry (LHK), 
and the local governments, communities and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs). [3-3a][3-3b][3-3c][3-3d]
[3-3e][3-3f]
PT Vale already has a mine closure plan document that 
was prepared in 2009 and approved in 2015. Regularly 
this document will be updated every 5 years by PT Vale.
Reforestation 
Beyond Boundary 
Post-mining land reclamation helps to improve 
land ecosystems, conservation and protection 
of protected and endemic flora and fauna 
species, and is a form of legal compliance. We are 
committed to limiting the open land areas for 
mining operations, and implementing biodiversity 
management in the mining operation areas in 
accordance with Approval Letter No.188.4/66/II/
BAPEDALDA. We also carry out land rehabilitation 
and transboundary reforestation activities outside 
the mining operation areas, especially in critical 
land and watersheds (DAS). In addition, there 
are no mine sites where acid drainage in PT Vale. 
[POJK51-6.e.1] [POJK51-6.e.3.b][EM-MM-160a.2]
By 2025, PT Vale’s targets are restoring 15,000 
hectares of land to become forest through its 
post-mining rehabilitation activities and the 
rehabilitation of critical land and watersheds. 
By the end of 2021 the accumulated land area 
rehabilitated was 3,249 Ha, which included 283.73 
Ha of land rehabilitated during 2021 is. For the 
remainder, we are targeting more than 10,000 Ha 
of land for reclamation and rehabilitation by 2024. 
In addition, PT Vale has also provided a budget of 
US$6,765,826 in 2021 and US$7,453,502 in 2022 for 
post-mining rehabilitation. 
Post Mining Rehabilitation
Implementation of Post-Mining 
Rehabilitation Activities
PT Vale’s mining operation areas are based on Contracts 
of Work with the Government of Indonesia, as amended in 
2014. 41,822.95 ha or 59% of the total Sorowako operation 
area of 70,894 ha is adjacent to a protected forest. PT Vale 
has obtained a Borrow-to-Use Forest Area Permit (IPPKH) 
from the KLHK in accordance with SK No. 645/MenLHK/
SetJen/PLA.0/12/2018. [304-1a][POJK51-6.e.3.a] [EM-MM-210a.1] [EM-MM-

PT Vale has also obtained an IPPKH for operations and 
production activities in Bahodopi Block I in Morowali 
Regency, Central Sulawesi, covering an area of 2,143.14 
hectares based on the Minister of Environment and 
Forestry Decree No. SK.341/Menlhk/Setjen/PLA.0/5/2019. 
The Company obtained a 2nd IPPKH extension for 
exploration activities in Bahodopi covering an area of 
12,820.60 Ha, based on the Minister of Environment and 
Forestry Decree No. SK.522/ Menlhk/Setjen/ PLA.0/11/2018. 
For the Pomalaa Block, Kolaka Regency, Southeast 
Sulawesi, PT Vale obtained an IPPKH for exploration 
activities covering an area of 12,563.10 hectares based on 
the Head of the Investment Coordinating Board Decree 
No. 6/1/IPPKH/PMA/2018. [304-1a] [POJK51-6.e.3.a]
We carry out open-pit mining activities, including 
land clearing and stripping soil surface, excavating soil 
materials and materials mines, also transporting soil 
materials and mining materials. These activities impact 
changes in the natural hue, thus affecting the ecosystem 
and the biodiversity therein. We manage impact by 
identifying species affected, followed by the transfer of 
the affected species to other locations, including post-
mining rehabilitation areas. We also carry out post-mining 
rehabilitation to restore the carrying capacity of the 
ecosystem in the former area mining operations. [304-2a]
[POJK51-6.e.2]
To minimize the ecosystem and biodiversity impact, we 
have also instigated a policy to limit the area of land opened 
annually for mining activities, in line with the reclamation 
guarantee for the period 2021–2022 as approved by the 
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, and for 2021 the 
area of open land will be limited to a maximum of 2,183.72 
hectares. The land area cleared for mining operations 
during the reporting period was 261.09 hectares, bringing 
the total area of land cleared for mining operations to 5,303 
hectares. Furthermore, there is no proved and probable 
reserves in or near areas of conflict. [304-2b] [EM-MM-210a.1]
The reclaimed mining area in 2021 was 283.74 hectares, or 
1.3% of the target of 280.12 hectares. Cumulatively, the 
post-mining reclamation area up to December 31, 2021 was 
3,249 hectares. The total remaining area of open land for 
mining activities in 2021 was 2,054 hectares, meeting the 
set limit. Also by the end of the reporting period all the 
rehabilitated land had been returned to its original state. 
All post-mining reclamation land is in Sorowako. [304-3a][MM1]

No. 4 concerning Mineral and Coal Mining. To 
realize our commitment to land rehabilitation 
and reclamation we provide financial 
resources, included in the environmental 
cost component in the Company’s Financial 
Statements. According to regulations, the 
Company has mine closure plans (RPT) in 
all (100%) mining operational areas in the 
Sorowako area, including a guarantee for 
mine closure. By 2021, PT Vale’s environmental 
management costs had amounted to 
US$21,349,994. [304-3b][MM10] [POJK51-6.d.1]
Locally trained communities are involved 
in the planting and maintenance activities. 
The Ministry of Energy and Mineral 
Resources regularly conducts monitoring 
and evaluation of the reclamation, to ensure 
it meets the planting criteria and can be 
handed over to the Government through 
the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. 
The success criteria include standards for 
land use, revegetation, and final settlement, 
based on to Attachment IV of the Minister

Biodiversity Conservation
PT Vale is committed to completing its biodiversity management plan, 
covering the entire mining operation areas in the Sorowako Block. By the end 
of the reporting period, the management has been implemented 100%. In 
2021, PT Vale continued the study of protected species started in 2020 with 
Hasanuddin University. The results show that several species of fauna and 
flora are protected or threatened with extinction, and need to be conserved 
to maintain their sustainability. The list of protected species based on the 
IUCN red list can be seen in Appendix 3. [304-4a][MM2][POJK51-6.e.3.b]
The solid waste generated from nickel in matte 
production processes include nickel slag and 
overburden material. During the reporting period, 
the Government issued Government Regulation (PP) 
No.22/2021 concerning the Environmental Protection 
and Management, which classifies nickel slag as non 
hazardous waste. We use nickel slag as a mining road 
pavement material. Overburden management is used 
as a backfill material and when compacted with soil 
reduces the risk of erosion. [306-1][306-2]
Reducing Landfill Load
Overburden material and topsoil are the solid waste 
generated from nickel ore mining operations, and are 
used as stockpile material in post-mining operations, 
for land and post-mining rehabilitation. Other non 
hazardous waste solid waste produced includes 
domestic waste and metal scrap. [POJK51-6.e.5.b]
In line with our environmental priority for 2021, 
namely reducing the landfill burden, several efforts 
were undertaken to optimize the waste generated 
from domestic activities and production processes. 
These efforts followed the reduce, reuse, recycle, 
and  recover or 4R concept. By doing so, the volume of 
domestic waste generated and disposed of at storage 
locations has been significantly reduced. Other non-
hazardous waste solid waste generated includes 
domestic waste and metal scrap. Third parties carry 
out the management of these two waste materials.

Another waste material containing non 
hazardous waste is nickel slag, which 
is generated from the nickel in matte 
production process. In 2021, a Government 
Regulation No. 22 concerning Environmental 
Protection and Management was released 
that stated that nickel slag waste is 
classified as non hazardous waste. Nickel 
slag is used as construction material for 
mining roads and special mining roads, 
based on the Ministry of Environment 
and Forestry Permit No. SK 121/Menlhk/
Setjen/PLB.3/2/2018 concerning hazardous 
waste utilization. The total volume of 
nickel slag generated in 2021 was 4,156,994 
tons, of which 97%, or 4,012,656 tons was 
reused. Other hazardous waste solid wastes 
are managed and processed based on their 
respective characteristics, and are used 
for internal purposes or handed over to 
licensed third parties. PT Vale has no non-
mineral waste and tailings produced. Also, no 
hazardous waste is shipped internationally. 
During 2021 there were no waste material 
spills that harmed the environment.

Reducing Water Usage Intensity
Our biggest use of water is in our hydropower operations. 
The water source comes from the Larona River, supplied 
from Lake Matano, Mahalona, and Towuti. The three lakes 
are also water sources for local residents, both to meet 
their domestic needs, as well as the livelihood of fishermen 
and farmers, as well as transportation. PT Vale manages 
hydroelectric power operations and uses water properly 
and carefully so as not to interfere with the interests of 
the local community. [303-1] [EM-MM-210b.1]
We manage our hydroelectric power operations and use 
water carefully so as not to interfere with the interests of 
the local communities. Efforts continue to be made with 
other stakeholders to clean up the lakes with 27 tons of 
garbage being cleared from Lake Matano. This was carried 
out in collaboration with the Environmental Service of 
East Luwu Regency, as well as the Center for Ecoregional 
Development of South Sulawesi and Maluku. We also 
carefully regulate the volume of water and the flow of 
water used to ensure that Lake Matano, Mahalona and 
Towuti water levels are maintained, as the three lakes have 
been designated as Nature Tourism Park Conservation Areas 
based on the Minister of Agriculture Decree No. 274/Kpts/
Um/4/1979 dated April 24, 1979. [303-2]
We look to optimize the water used for every ton of nickel 
in matte production, in accordance with Company Policy 
about Water Efficiency and Reduction of Wastewater 
Pollution Load. Detail about this policy can refers to http://
www.vale.com/indonesia/EN/sustainability/our-approach-
in-indonesia/Pages/policies.aspx. During 2021 the efforts 
undertaken included:
•	Reducing and controlling leaks in the water supply 
pipelines in the operational areas 
•	Controlling and reducing overflow in the Matte ponds 
•	Increasing employee awareness of water consumption 
savings and daily reporting of water consumption 
through daily FMDS meetings, and making water usage 
intensity a KPI
PT Vale takes water from the lake and sends it to the 
reservoir. However, we do not calculate the amount 
of water taken directly from the lake and the lake 
did experience water stress throughout 2021. PT Vale 
calculated that the total water usage in 2021 was 
8,681,643 m3, a decrease of 928,769 m3 or 9.7% from 
9,611,107 m3 in 2020. The Water Consumption Intensity 
value in 2021 decreased to 130.98 m3 per ton Ni, 
compared to 131.20 m3 per ton Ni in 2020. Routine water 
consumption intensity is reported by PT Vale through 
the RKL-RPL report, and to the public via website 
http://www.vale.com/indonesia/EN/sustainability/our-
approach-in-indonesia/Pages/reports.aspx. 
[303-5] [EM-MM-140a.1]
We also ensure that the quality of treated wastewater flowing 
into the tributaries leading to Lake Matano has met the quality 
standards set by the Government. The Company regularly 
analyzes the processed effluent using heavy metal content 
parameters. Periodically, the Company analyzes the processed 
effluent with parameters of heavy metal content. The analysis 
was carried out by an accredited independent laboratory, 
using the SNI 6989.59:2008 Water and Wastewater method 
During the reporting period we did not receive any 
complaints regarding alleged pollution of Lake Matano, 
Mahalona or Towuti. We have also never received sanctions 
related to alleged violations in environmental management.

In 2020, PT Vale launched the a Safe 
Work Permit (SWP) as a standard 
to be globally applied in all Vale 
units. SWPs are work permits that 
must be obtained for project and 
maintenance activities before 
carrying out the work. The purpose 
of an SWP is to ensure that all risks 
have been identified, and that 
safety controls are in place and 
comply with the New Golden Rules 
Number 9 (Risk Analysis). [403-1][403-8]
PT Vale applies the New Golden 
Rules to improve the protection 
of all employees and contractors/
suppliers from injury and fatalities. 
The New Golden Rules contain 10 
priorities that must be followed 
by employees and contractors/
suppliers. More information about

Key Hazard Identification and Employee Engagement 
The implementation of OHS involves the 
participation of employees and contractors/
suppliers workers. It begins with the identification 
of the main hazards and is managed with systems/
equipment inherent in operational activities, and 
includes all employees and contractors/suppliers 
workers. These activities are carried out through 
the Contractor Safety Management System (CSMS), 
General Induction Program (GIP), Site Specific 
Induction Program (SSIP), Risk Assessment (RA), Job 
Safety Analysis (JSA), Safety Talks, Critical Activity 
Requirements (CAR), Safe Work Permit (SWP), and 
field observations in the form of audits/inspections. 
[403-2a][403-4a]
PT Vale has adopted a mechanism where all 
employees can report any conditions that endanger 
safety and health at work. Reports are submitted 
to leader and via the web-based software and 
smartphone application IRIS, and depending on 
the priority of employee safety, we will remove 
employees from dangerous situations, and follow 
up on every report submitted by employees, 
including conducting investigations in the event of 
a work accident.
During 2021, our employee safety and security 
improvements and development activities included:

realize the vision of zero fatality. The 
activity involved the Vale SA CEO and the 
PT Vale CEO. [403-4a][403-9d]
Our OHS Central Committee is 
responsible for OHS through the OHS 
Central Committee meeting mechanism, 
where employee representatives can 
discuss any OHS matters. Management 
representatives forward the meeting 
results to the Company for follow-up. 
During 2021 the OHS Central Committee 
held 12 monthly meetings. [403-4b]
We also ensure contractors implement 
the Contractor Safety Management System (CSMS), and reward 
those contractors that manage OHS properly Contractor 
Awards. In 2021, awards were given to one national company, 
PT. Leighton Contractors Indonesia and 2 local companies, PT 
Welani Jaya and PT Sinar Sentosa Utama.
In 2021 the Company organized and included employees 
and contractor workers in OHS training. There were 64 OHS 
training sessions attended by 37,248 participants. Some of 
the OHS training involves certification to improve employees’ 
competencies: [403-5a][POJK51-6.c.2.d] 
·	First Operational Supervisor (POP) 
·	Middle Operations Supervisor (POM) 
·	Principal Operations Supervisor (POU)
·	Monthly mandatory contractor forums attended by PJO 
from all PT. Vale Indonesia, Tbk partner companies 
·	Annual internal SMKP audits for IUJP companies within PT. 
Vale Indonesia, Tbk 
·	SWP and JSA requests before carrying out work 
·	Monitoring and follow up on any golden rules violations 
(Smoking and phone detection)
The focus of OHS in 2021 was in the handling of the COVID-19 
pandemic and preventing occupational diseases (PAK). PT Vale 
organized vaccinations for its employees and contractors/
supplier worker, with 97% receiving vaccination-1, and 96% 
receiving vaccination-2. This was in compliance with the 
2021 Republic of Indonesia Minister of Health Regulation 
No. 10 concerning Vaccinations for Combating the COVID-19 
Pandemic, which regulated the gotong royong cooperation 
vaccine program (VGR), and independent vaccines 
carried out by private companies for their Beside that, 
PT Vale implement 3T [Testing, Treatment, and Tracing]

Employee Health 
Employee health is one of the essential factors in 
supporting the Company’s operational activities. 
Therefore by applicable government regulations, PT 
Vale provides normal working hours of 8 hours per day. 
PT Vale also covers its employees through the Social 
Security Administering Body (BPJS) health social security 
program whereby employees can access health facilities 
at referral hospitals. [403-6a]

all employees, and the Company facilitates this by 
collaborating with hospitals. During the reporting period, 
employees, 2,475 PTVI employees, 9,453 contractor 
employees, and 224 YPS-ATS employees undergo the 
MCU process.  
We also organize non-PAK health promotion activities 
for employees and contractor/supplier workers, 
including the prevention of HIV/AIDS, and the COVID-19 
pandemic, for which we received Gold predicate Awards 
from the Ministry of Manpower for the HIV/AIDS

(UCCR) located in the Utilities Office can operate 
the hydroelectric power plant and thermal plant 
remotely. The UCCR facility equipment is also capable 
of monitoring, providing information and analyzing 
the condition of dams, canals, geotechnical aspects, 
environmental aspects, and mobilizing the logistics 
units.
•	The Capital & Project Management Department 
continued the Shotcrete Project, especially for the 
hydro utilization area around the dam and logistics 
roads. This project involves the reinforcement 
of inclined planes to prevent landslides by laying 
foundations and spraying concentrate on the plane. 
The project is in accordance with the Indonesian Dam 
Safety Commission recommendations, and is used 
as part of the extension of PT Vale’s power plant 
operating license and certificate. The staged project 
has entered Phase 2 covering the areas of Karebbe, 
Balambano, Tawaki, and logistics roads. Phase 2 
completion is expected in 2023.

PT Vale has an open employee recruitment 
process, providing equal opportunities to all 
regardless of gender, ethnicity, religion, class, 
political affiliation, school/education or other 
matters that may give rise to allegations of 
discrimination. During 2021 we did not receive

“Early in my career at Vale, I felt that to be 
successful in a male-dominated industry 
and Company, I had to act, think and 
speak ‘like a man’. Now, if I look back many 
of my perceptions were actually wrong. 
We impose unnecessary boundaries on 
ourselves. The higher our position in the 
organization, the greater the responsibility 
to encourage others to succeed. As a 
leader, I recognize the influence I have on 
the organization. So many people rely on 
us to make a difference and create a more 
inclusive and more balanced environment. 
Diversity, equality and inclusivity are no

Ratio of Employment 
Benefits for Male and 
Female Employees
PT Vale pays employee benefits (remuneration) 
without discriminating between males 
and females, with a ratio of 1:1. The total 
remuneration for employees working at the 
same position level may be different, due to 
factors such as length of service, provision of 
benefits and incentives, including placement 
in certain locations and special jobs. Several 
allowances/incentives are provided to 
employees, namely Religious Allowance, Child 
Education Allowance, BPJS, Residence, and 
Maternity Leave. [405-2a]
The Company’s employee remuneration 
has been adjusted to the minimum 
wage regulations. In general, the lowest 
remuneration for PT Vale employees in 2021 
is still 114% higher than the minimum wage 
provisions in force in East Luwu Regency. 
Employees are also assigned based on their 
needs and competencies so they can develop, 
both in terms of career, abilities, and character.

and P3SRLB Program – Dongi 
Resettlement, Wasuponda
Building Synergy 
with the Government 
As a form of the Company’s concern for the local 
communities in the residential areas of Dongi in 
Wasuponda, PT Vale also carried out its infrastructure 
development and the P3SRLB Program throughout 2021. 
For infrastructure development, PT Vale renovated 
residents’ houses, constructed drainage and repaired 
roads. For the socio-economic sector, the Company 
provided assistance and technical capacity development 
for P3SRLB cultivation for groups in the Dongi area.
PT Vale understands the approaches taken with 
local community groups have not always satisfied 
everyone, but there have been no land disputes with 
the Company. Therefore, we will continue to improve 
our coordination and synergy with the East Luwu 
Regency Government through their input, direction, 
and guidance, and shared expectations to increase work 
and business opportunities for local communities.
The community 
empowerment program 
is the responsibility of 
the Social Development 
Program Function at 
the External Relations 
Department. For PPM, 
we continue to build 
communication and synergy 
with the Government and 
other stakeholders. 
PT Vale with the Ministry 
of Village, Development 
of Disadvantaged Regions, 
and Transmigration (PDTT), 
and the South Sulawesi 
Provincial Government 
and East Luwu Regency 
Government signed 
a Memorandum of 
Understanding (MoU) 
and Collective Labor 
Agreement (CLA), covering 
the PPM program and the 
Self Reliance Rural Area 
Development Program 
(PKPM). This signing was 
carried out to synergize the 
programs and activities for 
realizing the welfare of the 
community in the PT Vale 
empowerment area. The 
scope of cooperation covers 
PPM and PKPM, fostering and 
strengthening the government 
institutional capacity at the 
village and sub-district level, 
fostering and strengthening 
the Inter-Village Cooperation 
Agency (BAKD) capacity, and 
fostering and strengthening 
the capacity of village-owned 
enterprises (BUM-Des) and 
/ or joint village-owned 
enterprises (BUM-Desma).
The PPM-PKPM scope includes 
efforts to develop rural areas 
through spatial planning. The 
impact of this approach has 
led to a growth of service 
centers, and the development 
of villages in 10 development 
areas based on superior 
potential. The development 
areas are located in the Nuha, 
Towuti, Wasuponda, and Malili 
Districts. Development has been 
carried out to create tourism areas, 
integrated agriculture (Agropolitan), 
pepper plantations, and commodity 
processing trading and industry 
areas. Other areas will include 
animal husbandry and support, 
agro-tourism, livestock and non-
timber forest product processing, 
coastal and marine product 
processing industries (minapolitan), 
urban areas and services, and 
support for agriculture and animal 
husbandry.

the ESDM Ministry’s Disaster Preparedness Team.
Complaint Handling and 
Management Approach
[103-2][413-1][MM7] [POJK51-6.c.3.b]
PT Vale provides access to the public to 
submit and report complaints. All reported 
complaints are followed up by the External 
Relations Department with the related 
functions using various approaches. There 
were several complaints/grievances from 
the public, including those delivered directly 
during the monthly coordination meetings 
with the sub-districts on 2021. PT Vale have 
a  SDI System as application for handling 
every complains that still prepared on 2021. 
All work activities that will carried out by 
the Company always involves community in 
the early stages of implementation so that 
during 2021 PT Vale will not ever had a job

Governance Structure and 
Remuneration Policy [POJK51-5.a]
Based on the 2007 Law No. 40 concerning 
Limited Liability Companies, PT Vale’s 
governance structure consists of the General 
Meeting of Shareholders (GMS) as the highest 
governance body, the Board of Directors for the 
management of the Company, and the Board of 
Commissioners as the supervisor. The nomination 
and appointment of the Board of Directors and 
Board of Commissioners is under the authority of 
the Shareholders, and is ratified in the GMS. Complete 
information disclosure regarding the GMS, the Board of 
Directors, the Board of Commissioners, the Committees 
under the Board of Commissioners and functions 
under the Board of Directors, and the nomination and 
selection process for members of the Board of Directors 
and Board of Commissioners, can be found in the PT 
Vale Indonesia Tbk 2021 Annual Report. [2-9][2-10]
We ensure that there is no relationship between 
members of the Board of Directors with the Board 
of Commissioners, as well as internally between 
their respective Boards, which may cause a conflict 
of interest. There are no Shareholders with direct or 
indirect relationships with the Company’s suppliers or 
supply chain. During the reporting period there were 
no indications of a conflict of interest in any decisions 
made by PT Vale.  [2-15]
The Board of Commissioners and Board of Directors 
remuneration is determined through the GMS. The GMS 
delegated authority to the Board of Commissioners 
to determine the amount and remuneration for the 
Board of Directors, after taking into account the 
recommendations of the Company’s Governance, 
Nomination and Remuneration Committee. The 
shareholders are the only stakeholders involved in 
the process of determining the remuneration for the 
Board of Commissioners and the Board of Directors. 
Disclosure of information on the Board of Directors and 
the Board of Commissioners remuneration ratio can be 
found in the PT Vale Indonesia Tbk 2021 Annual Report. 
[2-19][2-20][2-21]
PT Vale requires the Board of 
Commissioners, Board of Directors, 
Company officials, employees and 
related parties act responsibly, honestly, 
confidently, respectfully and loyally; and 
comply with applicable legal obligations. 
This commitment’s success is reflected in 
the absence of fines or other legal sanctions 
during the reporting period, both from 
authorized institutions in managing the 
extractive industry, as well as from other 
regulators. [2-27]
Good governance 
implementation forms 
the basis for all of PT 
Vale’s operational and 
community activities 
to create more valuable 
sustainability, and 
increase the trust of all 
stakeholders.

Governance 
As of the end of the reporting 
period, PT Vale has not 
directly appointed a member 
of the Board of Directors 
responsible for sustainability 
performance. Responsibility 
and decision making for 
sustainability management 
is still the collective 
responsibility of the entire 
Board of Directors under the 
coordination of the President 
Director as the Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO), and 
the supervision of the Board 
of Commissioners. The Board 
of Directors’ sustainable 
governance includes the 
economic, environmental, and 
social aspects. Each member 
of the Board of Directors can 
delegate their sustainable 
governance responsibilities to 
Company officials reporting 
to them, based on the 
area of duty under their 
responsibility. [2-11][2-12]
Sustainable governance 
including environmental, 
social and governance (ESG) 
management, and the Board 
of Directors consults with 
stakeholders using several 
approach methods. Direct 
consultation is carried out 
by members of the Board 
of Directors, while indirect 
consultation is carried out 
by delegating authority to 
appointed Company officials 
according to the topics 
requiring consultation. In 
fulfilling their social and

(SER), the Board of Directors 
delegates its authority 
to the External Relations

Sustainability Risk Management 
Process Effectiveness
Risk management on the implementation 
of sustainability is part of implementing 
the Framework for Integrated Risk 
Management (FIRM), which was prepared 
to take into account ISO 31000, ISO 55001, 
and COSO-ERM on Risk Management and 
Asset Management. Risk management 
involves the Board of Directors and 
Board of Commissioners with the Board 
of Directors supported by management 
functions, namely Risk Management, Line 
Management, and Internal Audit. The 
Board of Commissioners assisted by the 
Risk Mitigation Committee supervises 
risk management. The Board of Directors 
and Board of Commissioners hold regular 
meetings to discuss risk management to 
ensure it is included and runs effectively in 
the 2021 sustainability. [2-18][POJK51-5.c]
During the reporting period, PT Vale carried 
out several activities involving stakeholders 
through the gemba walk and town hall 
meeting mechanism so stakeholders could 
convey important matters to the Board of 
Directors. The gemba walk was attended 
by functions and employees who conveyed 
a number of areas for improvement to the

Not all stakeholders understand the 
importance of a balance between economic, 
social and environmental aspects that forms 
the basis for sustainability performance. 
Diverse perceptions and interests among 
stakeholders can become obstacles and 
challenges in achieving sustainability 
performance, especially in the social and 
environmental aspects. Management of 
negative impacts also requires a lot of 
measurement and documentation that can 
be a problem due to limited capabilities 
or the variety of calculation methods. To 
overcome these obstacles and challenges, PT 
Vale is always improving its communication 
and training, as well as monitoring the 
calculation data as a basis for performance 
evaluation. [POJK51-5.e]

Disclosure
The direct economic value generated and distributed is 
an important basis for PT Vale’s sustainability. In 2021 
we produced 65,388 metric tons of nickel in matte, with 
sales reaching 65,388 metrik ton nickel 
in matte, with operating revenues of 
AS$953.17 million. Evaluation of the social 
community investments is carried out 
through direct monitoring of beneficiaries, 
and the achievement of Key Performance 
Indicators (KPI) targets. [3-3a][3-3b][3-3c][3-3.d]
[3-3.e][3-3.f]
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we applied 
various ways to maintain the Company’s 
stability. We also continued our innovation 
and superior operational activities by 
implementing the Vale Production System 
(VPS). The VPS requires the involvement

of all the key elements, employees, operations, 
maintenance, and management. The average 
production cost of nickel in matte in 2021 reached 
US$8,430 per ton, an increase from US$6,898 per ton in 
2020 due to an increase in energy prices.
“Throughout 2021, PT Vale carried out critical maintenance 
in the operational processes, and maintained its production 
and sales, despite the challenges of tackling the COVID-19 
pandemic, which is still our shared responsibility.”

Target and Realization
During the reporting period, we faced 
physical climate change in the form 
of weather anomalies, which affected 
the nickel ore mining operations, as 
well as the delivery of nickel in matte 
to customers. This impacted PT Vale’s 
finances, which experienced additional 
operating expenses. However, the 
Company optimized its nickel ore and 
nickel in matte production, and sales 
and delivery of nickel in matte, thus 
meeting the set targets. [201-2ai][201-2aii]

our development efforts 
to increase the production 
capacity to 90,000 tons 
of nickel in matte, which 
is targeted for 2026. The 
strategic steps taken by the 
Company included:
•	The Company signed 
a Project Cooperation 
Framework Agreement/

Value Management 
[2-6] [POJK51.6.c.3.a]
PT Vale’s operations 
and business activities 
provide indirect benefits 
to the community through 
employment opportunities 
for local communities as 
employees in contractor/
supplier companies in 
the Company’s supply 
chain. Local companies 
are defined as companies 
located and/or operating 
in East Luwu Regency. 
Contractor/supplier 
company employees are 
compensated for their 
work, which they use to 
meet the necessities of life 
including shopping, creating 
a chain effect on the local 
economy.
As of December 31, 2021, 
there were 295 local 
companies as part of the 
Company’s supply chain, or 
28.45% of the total number 
of vendors/suppliers.
standards compliance, and 
is based on ISO 9001:2008 
and ISO 17025:2008 
certifications. [416-1][416-2] 
Nickel in matte to buyers 
is shipped in special 
packages with a capacity 
of 3.3 tons. On the outside 
of the package are labels 
explaining the product 
specifications and handling 
methods. During 2021, 
there were no complaints 
made by buyers regarding 
discrepancies in the 
information on the labels. 
PT Vale has conducted 
compliance assessments on 
labeling procedures for all 
(100%) of its products. [417-1]
[417-2]
During the reporting 
period, PT Vale did not 
innovate any of our 
products, but continued 
to improve production 
efficiencies for nickel in 
matte, our intermediate 
product that is further 
processed by our buyers, 
VCL and SMM. Nickel in 
matte products do not 
directly affect the safety 
and security of customers, 
and do not directly impact 
the users, so no special 
handling is required. Nickel 
that has been processed 
into the final product can 
be recycled. During the 
reporting period, PT Vale 
did not receive any claims 
for products or product 
recalls.  [POJK51-6.f.1] [POJK51-
6.f.3] [POJK51-6.f.4]
During 2021, there were 
no recalled products as 
we already had long-term 
contracts with established 
standards. In addition, PT 
Vale has implemented an 
Integrated Vale Production 
System as a standard for 
evaluating the safety and 
quality of each product 
(100%) starting at the 
operational level. [POJK51-6.c.1] 
[POJK51-6.f.2]
All (100%) of PT Vale’s 
products have been 
assessed for their health 
and safety impacts, so 
there were no complaints 
regarding safety, health 
and security from our 
employees, contractor 
workers or customers. 
The nickel in matte 
production process and 
products comply with 
the safety, health and 
security requirements. The
