surrounding community.
Transfer of knowledge from foreign workers of 
local employment
WHW understands that the operational of alumina 
refining technology requires  special skills in order 
for the technology to bring maximum benefit 
for the community.
To 
anticipate this, WHW is bringing Foreign Workers 
(TKA) to Indonesia to perform technological 
transfer.
Out of the 2,800 workers WHW currently 
has, only 9% are foreign workers.
They are experts 
brought in by the Chinese Shareholders for 
technological transfer purposes.
No the local 
workers who originally did not possess any skill 
in SGA technology can be positioned in strategic 
position in the WHW production process.
In China 
the local workers had the opportunity to learn 
machine technology and safety basics.
Through this technological transfer, WHW is 
taking an active role in the effort to increase 
the wellbeing of the employees.
This is evident 
from the strategic decision making position of 
WHW which are occupied by local talents from 
Kendawangan and Ketapang.
