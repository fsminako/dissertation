a post-mining plan.
In 2021, ITM has realized total post-mining 
costs of USD352 thousand.
In 
2021, ITM has calculated the carbon sequestration in 
the area of ​
177.17 ha of post-mining reclamation land 
in EMB, amounted to 58,362.47 ton CO2.
Of the 219.85 ha of measurable 
reclamation area, an estimated carbon sequestration 
of 43,058.64 tons CO2 was recorded.
This 
activity has reduced the total void area by 30 ha or 
decreased by 40% from the previous void area.
Watershed Rehabilitation (DAS)
ITM as the IPPKH holder is obliged to carry out 
watershed rehabilitation in its concession areas, based 
on the Decree of the Minister of Forestry No.
Notes:
The number of trees planted reached 14 million trees.
The handover of planting areas for 
watershed rehabilitation in 2021 was held for areas planted by 
KTD, TCM, BEK, and JBG.
ITM has the obligation to rehabilitate 48.010,94 
hectares watershed areas until 2026.
In 2021, ITM has handed over the 
results of planting  area of 6.893 Ha in the watershed 
rehabilitation area.
to the government.
ITM involved 14 local contractors in the watershed 
rehabilitation process, as a support to drive the 
local economy through employment and provision 
of plant seeds.
The planting sites cover 17 villages in 8 districts, 
with a total area of 250 hectares.
Coastal area conservation in 
Bontang Lestari District and Santan Ilir Village, Kutai 
Kartanegara Regency is carried out by subsidiary, 
IMM.
Activities are carried out by involving the 
community through mangrove planting and coral reef 
transplantation.
This is due to coastal conditions that 
have a high level of abrasion and the condition of coral 
islands that sink during high tide.
The company and the community initiated to plant 
an accumulated 130,000 mangrove seedlings in an 
area of ​
​
72 hectares.
The planting aimed to protect 
the coast from abrasion, increase fish production, and 
ecotourism.
From this program, 
IMM has calculated carbon sequestration in the area 
of 34 Ha with the amount of carbon sequestration 
from mangrove stands of 1,402.79 tons of CO2 and soil 
carbon sequestration at a depth of 20 cm of 1,295,441 
tons of CO2.
The evaluation of waste management is carried out 
through an assessment mechanism of periodic reporting 
to the authorities.
The evaluation results show a 
decrease in the amount of B3 waste managed by 3R due 
to a decrease in the total volume of waste.
