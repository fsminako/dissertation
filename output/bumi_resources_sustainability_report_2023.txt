employees and work partners are invaluable assets in achieving the company’s 
economic success.
Despite the decline in global coal prices 
and average selling prices, the Company managed to achieve optimal economic 
performance by increasing production volume to 77.8 million tonnes and coal sales 
to 78.7 million tonnes, marking a 13% increase from the previous year.
This robust 
economic performance demonstrates the company’s resilience and fortitude in 
navigating global economic challenges.
MANAGEMENT OF MATERIAL 
TOPICS
Impact of Material Topic
The economic performance serves as a catalyst 
for business sustainability, playing a crucial role in 
facilitating the transition to renewable energy and 
serving as a significant source of investment and 
income for local communities, nations, and regions.
We continue to maintain and manage economic 
performance in 2023 from risks that potentially reduce 
economic performance.
We articulate this commitment in our Human 
Rights Policy version 1.0 where we prohibit all forms 
of indications that lead to acts of corruption and 
bribery.
We contribute in 
ensuring the implementation of honesty in the supply 
chain by disseminating the Code of Conduct version 
4.0 to contractors, subcontractors and other work 
partners.
Management of Impact 
Economic performance management is under the 
authority of internal audit division which analyzes 
and evaluates internal controls related to operational 
effectiveness and efficiency in the areas of finance, 
accounting, operations, human resources, marketing, 
information technology and other important areas.
This system is designed with 
the objective of achieving reliability and accuracy of 
financial and operating information, effectiveness and 
efficiency in operations, protection of physical assets, 
and compliance with all relevant laws, regulations and 
contracts.
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE
In 2023, the volume of coal mined reached 77.8 million 
tons, an increase of 8% compared to 2022, which stood 
at 71.9 million tons.
Approximately 
40% of gross revenue was allocated for royalties, taxes, 
and subsidies, significantly affecting liquidity and 
margins.
This had a significant impact on net profit, 
which amounted to USD 10.9 million, a significant 
decrease of 97.9%.
In March 
2023, we conducted a private placement, issuing 
28,229 Series C shares.
This action has brought the 
company’s debt level down to 99.9% of the 2017 level.
We anticipate that our future economic performance 
will strengthen further, buoyed by diminished financial 
obligations and substantial coal reserves.
The Sangatta mine is located close to 
the port facilities at Tanjung Bara, which is connected 
to the mine site by a 13-kilometre overland conveyor 
(OLC).

Pinang, has lower calories than Prima with a higher 
humidity level.
The coal 
is broken down, separated and then washed to reduce 
its ash content in order to increase its selling price.
The coal has very low sulfur and ash content, 
so it is categorized as environmentally friendly coal.

During the reporting period, the Company’s operational 
activities experienced obstacles as an indirect impact 
of climate change such as weather anomalies and 
landslides.
In responding to these impacts and risks, 
we temporarily suspended mining operations to 
ensure there are no work accidents.
Nonetheless, we 
manage the risks through increasing energy efficiency, 
transitioning to renewable energy, and reforestation.
This is proven that there are no products that violate 
regulations and are prohibited from circulation by the 
Government.
The mechanism that 
was introduced in 2006 and has been updated by the 
latest memorandum approved on 28 February 2008 is 
our effort to prevent fraud.
The 
company has an independent Internal Audit division 
that conducts periodic and random operational audits.
The Internal Audit Division will then report the results 
of the audit to the Audit Committee.

To that end, through the development of 
a selection system and evaluation of procedures, BUMI 
demonstrates its commitment to the sustainability of 
procurement.
The standard includes a clause in the contract related 
to the environmental management and OHS obligations 
in accordance with the applicable regulations.
To ensure that the suppliers 
will comply with all the requirements requested by the 
Company, the suppliers are required to sign a mutually 
agreed employment contract.
To assess the implementation of sustainability aspects 
including respect for human rights, we have conducted 
due diligence on suppliers at KPC and Arutmin.
KPC and Arutmin have conducted extensive awareness 
raising on both BUMI’s Human Rights Policy and Human 
Rights Policy at the business unit level.
This comprehensive initiative 
encompasses, expanding the designated parking areas for 
employee motorbikes and buses (manhauls), establishing 
a designated pedestrian pathways, and revising the 
Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for employee pick-
up and drop-off activities.
In response to the finding, Jhonlin Baratama, acting as a 
contractor, has replaced its catering supplier to vendor 
possessing expertise in maintaining high food quality 
standards and adhering to rigorous packaging protocols.
This includes 
quarterly inspections of contractor-operated canteens 
and food hygiene, and comprehensive food durability tests 
to mitigate the potential risks associated with foodborne 
illnesses and spoilage.

MANAGEMENT OF MATERIAL 
TOPICS
Impact of Material Topic
Respecting labor rights and investing in human 
resource development is an essential strategy for the 
company to achieve sustainability targets, gain market 
access, and increase our resilience to address future 
challenges.
High-quality human resources serve as the cornerstone for companies to survive 
and grow amidst escalating global challenges.
In 2023, we implemented an array 
of human resource strategies to build resilience.
These strategies encompass 
respecting labor rights, fostering just and favorable working conditions, and 
investing in upskilling and reskilling initiatives through comprehensive training 
programs.
We believe our transformative efforts can bolster the achievement of 
company objectives and enhance sustainability performance.
Commitment and Policy
Our commitment to respecting employee rights, 
including 
inclusive 
human 
resource 
capacity 
development, is outlined in the Group Human Rights 
Policy version 1.0, KPC‘s Human Rights, Sustainable 
Development and Business Performance Improvement 
Policy version 2022, and the Arutmin‘s  Human 
Rights Policy version 2022.
These polices are in line 
with national and international human rights laws 
and instruments such as the International Bill of 
Human Rights, UNGPs, ILO Declaration on Workers’ 
Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, Law No.
13 of 2003 concerning Employment, and Law No.
In practice, we alternate between 
regular shifts (12-13 hours) and reserve shifts (8 hours) 
as needed.
The shift rotation is intended to reduce 
long-shift hours which can impact the health and 
safety of our employees.
Employees are not 
fully aware of the 
BUMI and business 
unit human rights 
policies.
Human rights policies 
for both business units and BUMI are disseminated 
alongside other materials, such as a Code of Conduct 
and Contractor Management System.
Management of Impact 
We have identified and assessed potential impacts 
related to fulfilling employee rights by conducting due 
diligence in 2022.

Additionally, we conduct regular 
audits to ensure that all contractor and subcontractor 
employees receive fair compensation that meets or 
exceeds minimum wage standards.
As a result of these 
robust mechanisms and diligent efforts, we are pleased 
to report that there were no instances of child labor or 
forced labor reported during the reporting period.
Amidst 
industrial transformations, digitalization, and rapid 
shifts in the workforce, prioritizing investments in

The Engagement Survey conducted by Arutmin involved 
81% of the total employees, which was an increase 
of 5.8% from the survey conducted in the previous 
year.
All of them (100%) 
were accepted to work again in their original positions 
and regained their rights after maternity leave ended.
As mentioned 
in the HRDD result, while there is a case where 
contractors do not have labour unions, the business 
partners in question are actively organizing LKS 
Bipartit as an avenue for employees to communicate 
their grievances other than through Speak-Up System.
To participate in the activities of the Labor Union, 
employees can apply for permits or dispensations.
The granting of permits and dispensations has been 
carefully reviewed and regulated in a CLA between the 
Company and the trade union which has been approved 
by the Ministry of Manpower and Transmigration.
Our 
CLA has protected 100% of the employees who work 
both in the holding and business units.
Both KPC and Arutmin continue 
to coordinate with partners in terms of ensuring 
the fulfillment of workers’ rights in accordance with 
Indonesian Government regulations.
(402-1)
In addition, as an effort to create and maintain 
harmonious relationships, KPC seeks to involve 
employees or labor unions in formulating most of 
the company’s policies.
These 
provisions are in accordance with the applicable 
Company Regulations or CLA.

TOPICS
Material Topic Impact
We recognize that our mining operations can 
result both positive and negative impacts on the 
human rights of stakeholders, including employees, 
contractor workers, and local communities.
Additionally, 
we acknowledge a growing straight-line connection 
between the significant social impacts generated by 
business activities—both positive and negative—and 
the associated business risks and opportunities.
BUMI acknowledges the significance 
of this principle in sustainable development and addressing global challenges, 
such as the transition to a low-carbon economy.
We reaffirm our commitment to 
uphold human rights.
Our practices are guided by universally recognized human 
rights principles and implemented through BUMI’s Human Rights Commitment 
Version 1.0.
Such oversight can lead to substantial material 
financial risks over the short, medium, or long-term 
periods.
Conversely, businesses that respect the 
human rights of their stakeholders stand to enhance 
their reputation, resilience, and attractiveness as 
employers and partners.
HUMAN RIGHTS POLICY
We integrate respect for human rights in all aspects of 
the business and articulate this commitment in Human 
Rights Policy version 1.0 which was formed in 2018 and 
was signed by the most senior level of the Company.

After successfully carrying out human rights due 
diligence in 2022, we are committed to further 
enhancing our efforts in 2023.
This proactive approach underscores 
our unwavering commitment to upholding human 
rights standards and ensures that we remain vigilant 
in addressing any existing gaps or challenges.
The 
implementation of this due diligence was initiated by 
the BUMI Human Rights Coordinating Team, assisted 
by an independent external human rights expert in 
accordance with the United Nations Guiding Principles 
for Business and Human Rights.
Subsequently, we collaborated with 
the business units to develop an action plan based on 
the findings of the due diligence and communicated 
the results to stakeholders through a Human Rights

Team consisting of Mahmud, Vice President of Human 
Resources – GA Division, and Tofan Wibisono, Senior 
Manager of Sustainability and CSR Department.
The team is directly under the president director of 
BUMI.
This shows a strong commitment from top 
management to respect human rights in BUMI and its

At the business unit level, Arutmin has established 
a Human Rights Coordinating Team comprising the 
Head of Mining Engineering from each Arutmin site.
This team will provide regular reports on human 
rights performance to the CEO of Arutmin.
Similarly, 
KPC is currently in the process of setting up a Human 
Rights Coordinating Team, with members drawn from 
departments responsible for human rights matters.
For instance, oversight of human rights in the supply 
chain will fall under the purview of the Supply Chain 
Department (SCD).
Our efforts to promote and uphold human 
rights have been demonstrated through a series of 
impactful activities, including:
1.
Conducting in-person refresher training sessions 
on human rights and the Code of Conduct for 51 
Arutmin employees and contractors in-person.
Additionally, KPC’s Supply Chain Department 
organized Code of Conduct outreach sessions for 
93 contractor and subcontractor employees.

measures, and reassessing the impact of blasting on 
surrounding communities.
In addition to identifying risks, we actively monitor the 
attainment of environmental management objectives.
In practice, BUMI designates environmental specialists 
tasked with overseeing KPC and Arutmin operations 
in line with established Objectives, Targets, and

performance of KPC and Arutmin aligns with the set 
OTP for 2023.
In our business units, KPC and Arutmin, fuel energy is 
needed to operate heavy machinery and equipment.
The company has identified strategies to respond 
climate risks and opportunities.
Biodiesel, 
being a renewable energy substitute for diesel fuel, 
emits fewer greenhouse gases during combustion.
To maximize the efficacy of biodiesel adoption, KPC 
and Arutmin have conducted extensive trials and fine-
tuned their heavy equipment to accommodate its 
usage, alongside enhancing the quality of biodiesel 
production.
In 2023, the total energy consumption of KPC biodiesel

longitude and 0o32’0.00”- 0o51’29.595” north side.
The Special Mining Business License (IUPK) of KPC 
areas covers the North Sangatta and Bengalon in 
the north side, while in the southern part IUPK spans 
from South Sangatta Subdistrict and Rantau Pulung.
Plans submission for mining openings, preparing facilities and  
infrastructure for erosion and sedimentation control, identification 
of flora and fauna species, clearing of vegetation, stripping and 
management of soil layers of the root zone in accordance with the 
approved annual plan.
Identification of local plants before land clearing for propagation in 
the nursery.
Topsoil storage which will then be reused when the reclamation area 
is ready.
Landscape changes, 
groundwater

Formation of embankment slopes, construction of drainage canals 
and erosion control structures and spreading of root zone soil.
(304-3)
At each stage of the activities, impact management 
actions are carried to manage the impact so that it 
is safe and in accordance with the rules.
The plant species planted in the 
reclamation area are selected based on the land cover 
function which is in accordance with their designation.
In 2023, the area of land cleared by KPC was 2.236,40 
hectares with a cumulative area of 36.624,94 hectares, 
while the rehabilitation area was 738,13  hectares, a 
decrease from the previous year which was 826,34 
hectares.
KPC has completed the reclamation 
commitment of the 2022 for an area of 177.68 hectares 
and reclamation of Mine Closure Pit A covering an area 
of 99.72 hectares, so that the cumulative area in 2023 
reached 14,608.04 hectares.
The number of trees that 
were successfully planted was 835,185 trees, a decrease 
from the previous year’s 885,256 trees.
Sedangkan 
On the other hand, by the end of 2023 the total area 
of land cleared by Arutmin for mining activities and 
its supporting facilities reached 17,250.32 hectares.
Of the total disturbed land area, during 2023 a total 
of 311.65 hectares of the land has been rehabilitated, 
with a cumulative 9,343.18 hectares of land having 
been rearranged and approximately 221,19 hectares 
have been planted.
The cumulative ratio of rearranged 
land to total cleared area is 54.16%, while the ratio 
of revegetated land to total cleared area is 51.01%.
During 2023, planting has been carried out in a 
watershed area of approximately 1,489.69 hectares 
with 1,242,401 trees and a cumulative area up to 2023 
covered 5.633,51 hectares with a total of 4.698.347 
trees.
The watershed rehabilitation area is located 
in Banjar, Tanah Laut and Tanah Bumbu Regencies, 
South Kalimantan Province.
The 
number of natural tree species and revegetation that 
results in the 16 reclamation areas varied considerably.
The presence of understorey species in the post-
mining reclamation area is very important, because it 
can invite wild animals to find food and seek shelter.
The value of tree biodiversity is moderate, that is 1-3.
PROTECTION OF FLORA AND 
FAUNA SPECIES  
Of the 16 reclamation areas at KPC, 24 species of 
mammals have been inhabited, this number has 
increased by 3 species over a period of 3 years of 
observation.
Over 24 species, 11 of them are protected 
and are target of illegal hunting with relatively 
high economic value.
Arutmin, the business unit cooperates with the Natural 
Resources Conservation Agency (BKSDA) in the realm 
of planning, institutional strengthening, protection and 
safeguarding of flora and fauna preservation areas in 
South Kalimantan.
In addition, there are 54 species of birds in the 
KPC post-mining reclamation area, this number is 
exceeding the number of birds from the natural area.
With an index value of 3.14 units, which means a high 
biodiversity value (H’ > 3).
Based on the Mackinnon list 
(observation sheet), with the graph climbing up to the 
17th list, this indicates the possibility of finding other 
bird species that have not been observed in the KPC 
post-mining reclamation area.
With a biodiversity index 
of 1.987 (H ‘= 1-3, biodiversity is classified as moderate).
