Processed through PPHI under Law No.
Regulatory 
compliance is directly monitored by the Director 
of Environment Health & Safety (EHS).
Related to SO2 emission reduction, the Company has met 
the quality standards stipulated in the Regulation of the 
Minister of Environment No.
Compliance with 
the emission standard for nickel matte processing plant 
was calculated based on mass balance with the quality 
standard of 0.86 and the Company’s mass balance of 0.78.
The construction of mine effluent management facilities 
with LGS (Lamella Gravity Settler) technology have 
been completed and entered the commissioning phase 
to achieve the appropriate operating parameters.
Construction of the effluent treatment system with LGS 
technology reduces the contamination load from mine 
runoff water that flows into Lake Matano, especially TSS 
parameter.
We have started the 
AMDAL preparation on plans to increase nickel 
production capacity in Luwu Timur, South 
Sulawesi, and the construction of nickel plant in 
Morowali Regency, Central Sulawesi.
The AMDAL 
is prepared based on the Regulation of the 
Minister of Environment No.5 of 2012, and No.
17 
of 2012 governing the preparation of AMDAL and 
Environmental Permit.
In 2015, the Company completed the preparation 
of AMDAL Document of Pomalaa Block in 
Kolaka, Southeast Sulawesi.
Describe in depth on action plans that include 
the location and schedule of activities, the 
construction of plants, ports, dams, and plans 
for employment.
Deeper analysis of the activities impact on the 
environment, such as the quality of surface 
water, sea, protected forests, biodiversity, 
land rights of indigenous communities, and 
disruption of livelihoods.
Relocate the site plan of port to avoid the 
regency’s strategic area for the development 
of mangrove forests.
Coordinate closely with the central 
government, relevant agencies and local 
governments in compliance with laws and 
regulations, the implementation of CSR 
programs and employment.
Disseminate the action plan execution 
transparently and intensively to the 
concerned parties and affected communities.
Consider the study area boundaries by 
excluding East Kolaka Regency due to all 
activity plans are in Kolaka Regency.
This identification is related to the 
efficiency and preserving the environment.
A total of 58.92% of the area (41,822.95 Ha) is 
protected area.
The change of landscape resulted from mining 
activities in the form of slopes and large deposits 
will be backfilled with overburden material that 
will be reorganized to resemble the landscape 
with a slope ratio of 1: 3.
The surface of the land 
will then be covered with top soil of 30-cm thick.
The rehabilitated/reclaimed area reached 3,983.5 
hectares, with a total of 1,859,107 planted trees.
Post-mining land rehabilitation phase includes 
restructuring or formation of land surface 
with rehabilitated land slope standard, 
topsoil restoration, erosion control, drainage 
construction, road building, revegetation, 
reforestation by planting pioneer and endemic 
plants, plant maintenance, and success 
monitoring.
This increase was 
due to increased nickel production volume in 
2015, which amounted to 2,451 tons.
The negative impact is 
mitigated by monitoring the solid content of the 
effluent in sedimentation ponds before being 
discharged into the water body.
[G4-EN26]
We have built sedimentation ponds with capacity 
of 3.5 million m2, which have the function to 
precipitate the dissolved solids in it, by adding 
ferrous sulphate monohydrate.
In general, the energy consumption in 2015 
increased 7% to 28,552,292.40 GJ, compared 
to 2014 amounted to 26,613,595.40 GJ.
The energy intensity from 2014 to 2015 rose by 
5%.
Emission 
control programs refer to the Decree of the 
State Minister of Environment No.
13 of 
1995 on Quality Standard of Emissions from 
Stationary Sources and Circular of the Ministry 
of Environment No.
B-8594/MENLH/09/2011, on 
SO2 emissions for nickel industry.
Emission control includes monitoring and 
measuring the quality of reduction furnace, 
smelting furnace and dryer kiln stacks.
Measurements are conducted by accredited 
independent laboratory.
Emission measurement results are reported 
regularly to the Government through the 
Environmental Management Plan (RKL) and 
Environmental Monitoring Plan (RPL).
The 
emission monitoring results found the emission 
threshold of the stacks during 2015 met the 
quality standards set by the Government.
Through these 
efforts, until the end of 2015, SO2 emissions 
were calculated at 0.79 kg SO2/kg Ni, down from 
emissions in 2014 of 0.86 kg SO2/kg Ni.
By the end of 2015, SOx emission 
from the stacks was measured at 63,991 tons, 
while total CO2 emission was 32,372,537 tons.
The amount of CO2 deceased from the previous 
year of 34,396,098 tons.
Waste Management
Waste of lateritic nickel ore mining activities 
is overburden, top soil, and rocks.
Overburden 
material volume in 2015 reached 42,422,043 
WMT, an increase over 2014 amounted to 
33,335,407 WMT.
The increase of overburden 
material volume was due to increasing mining 
activities.
[G4-EN23, MM3]
We manage the overburden material by means 
of: [G4-EN23, MM3]

Positive Refraction in Paradigm Shift
Paradigm shift is an important aspect of community empower-
ment.
“Nowadays, we move with our responsibility 
for the community, and spread that to our colleagues in other 
communities.
In the earlier days, the youth had uncreative mindsets due to 
their lack of educational background.
After they had lead the 
local business with responsibilities, their mental and mindset 
improved.
Their grievance was about the 2014 amendment 
of Contract of Work area boundary map
