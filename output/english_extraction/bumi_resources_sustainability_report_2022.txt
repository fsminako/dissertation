There are no significant

association and assembly.
As mentioned in the HRDD 
result, while there is a case where contractors do not 
have labour unions, the business partners in question 
are actively organizing LKS Bipartit as an avenue for 
employees to communicate their grievances other 
than through Speak-Up System.
To participate in the activities of the Labor Union, 
Employees can apply for permits or dispensations.
The granting of permits and dispensations has 
been carefully reviewed and regulated in a CLA 
between the Company and the trade union which 
has been approved by the Ministry of Manpower 
and Transmigration.
Our CLA has protected 100% 
of the employees who work both in the holding and 
business units.
Both KPC and Arutmin continue to coordinate 
with partners in terms of ensuring the fulfillment 
of workers’ rights in accordance with Indonesian 
Government regulations.
(402-1)
In addition, as an effort to create and maintain 
harmonious relationships, KPC seeks to involve 
employees or labor unions in formulating most of 
the company’s policies.
These provisions are in accordance with the 
applicable Company Regulations or CLA.

The implementation 
of this due diligence was initiated by the BUMI 
Human Rights Coordinating Team, assisted by an 
independent external party who has competence in 
human rights respect in accordance with the United 
Nations Guiding Principles for Business and Human 
Rights.
Additionally, we reviewed relevant policy documents 
to ensure that policies in our business units endorse 
respect for human rights.
Based on the results of human rights due diligence, 
we documented leading practices and room for 
improvement for BUMI in the efforts to respect 
and promote respect for human rights.
We will upload the due diligence report on the 
Company‘s website to ensure the accessibility of the 
information to our stakeholders.
BUMI‘s efforts to encourage respect for human rights 
in the country further strengthen BUMI as a pioneer 
company in adopting respect for human rights based 
on international frameworks.
Through 
the Decree of the Board of Directors No.

BR-BOD/XII/18, BUMI has set up a Human Rights 
Coordinating Team consisting of Mahmud, Vice 
President of Human Resources – GA Division, and 
Tofan Wibisono, Senior Manager of Sustainability 
and CSR Department.
The team is directly under 
the president director of BUMI.
This shows a strong 
commitment from top management to respect 
human rights in BUMI and its subsidiaries.
The Human Rights 
Coordinating Team has repeatedly coordinated 
with KPC and Arutmin discussing the technicality 
and mechanism for due diligence and the results 
dissemination.
The number of employees 
who participated in this human rights socialization 
and training included members of the security 
guard from our business unit.
We are proud 
because in 2022, we have included aspects of respect 
for human rights in all cooperation agreements with a 
contract value amounting to IDR 2,860,458,249.

Biodiesel is a renewable 
energy source that can replace fossil fuels as an 
energy source in company operations.
In order to 
optimize the utilization of this biodiesel, KPC and 
Arutmin have conducted a series of trials and 
adjustments to the heavy equipment they have and 
improve the quality of the biodiesel.
Biodiesel fuel usage reached 42% of the total diesel fuel.
The company’s business activities that require 
high energy trigger global warming through the 
production of greenhouse gas emissions.
Currently, 
all countries have concentrated on overcoming 
this problem, including Indonesia.
The Indonesian 
government is committed to taking a role in reducing 
greenhouse gas emissions through Law No.
16 of 
2016 concerning Ratification of the Paris Agreement 
to The United Nations Framework Convention on 
Climate Change.
The law contains the Government’s 
obligation to contribute to reducing greenhouse 
gas (GHG) emissions to limit the rise in global 
average temperatures below 2°C to 1.5°C from pre-
industrialization levels.
In line with that, the 
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources has 
targeted reducing GHG emissions in the energy 
sector by 314 million tons of CO2 in 2030.
Emission 
reductions are targeted to reach 32% with their own 
efforts and 43% with international support.
As a coal mining company that is responsible and has 
environmental awareness, BUMI supports the GHG 
emission reduction target that has been announced 
by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources.
In order to inhibit and 
reduce these impacts, we are committed to running 
more efficient business operations and reducing 
carbon emissions in all of our business activities.

Raw Materials Usage
KPC and Arutmin’s operational activities are generally 
divided into coal mining and washing processes to 
improve coal quality so that the heat value increases 
and the content of dust and other polluting media 
decreases.
The company 
processed 1.78 million m3 or 54,04% of the total 
raw water through water treatment plant facilities in 
2022.
.
KPC conducts a regular water quality control and 
management as required by the regulation to ensure 
that 100% of the water discharged into water bodies 
meets the water quality standards stipulated by 
applicable regulations.
Waste water from the coal stockpile and TPS FABA 
is managed through a settling pond, while the waste 
from the power station is managed through a waste 
water treatment plant.
Waste water discharged into 
the environment is ensured to meet quality standards 
and is only released through compliance points 
approved by the government.
Pollution Control Through 
Wastewater Management Mine 
and Domestic Wastewater 
By the end of 2022, KPC had actively and routinely 
made efforts to manage the quality of wastewater.
In 2022, Arutmin discharged 
12.4 million m3 of wastewater by adding 1.971 
tons of lime and 361 tons of alum.
Routine measurement and management of water 
quality parameters revealed that the quality of 
the water released into water bodies met 100% 
of the quality standards set by applicable laws 
and regulations.
At the end of 2022, KPC had 
54 management points, comprising of 36 mine 
wastewater compliance points, 7 wastewater to the 
sea management points and 11 domestic wastewater 
compliance points.
Results indicated that the water 
quality at all monitoring locations meet the required 
quality standards during 2022.
In general, the water 
that discharged from Arutmin’s operational locations 
had met the quality standards required both in the 
Decree of the Minister of Environment No.

The watershed rehabilitation 
area is located in Banjar, Tanah Laut and Tanah 
Bumbu Regencies, South Kalimantan Province.
The 
number of natural tree species and revegetation 
that results in the 16 reclamation areas varied 
considerably.
The presence of understorey species in 
the post-mining reclamation area is very important, 
because it can invite wild animals to find food 
and seek shelter.
The value of tree biodiversity is 
moderate, that is 1-3.
Protection of Flora and Fauna Species 
Of the 16 reclamation areas at KPC, 24 species of 
mammals have been inhabited, this number has 
increased by 3 species over a period of 3 years 
of observation.
Over 24 species, 11 of them are 
protected and are target of illegal hunting with 
relatively high economic value.
In addition, there are 54 species of birds in the 
KPC post-mining reclamation area, this number is 
exceeding the number of birds from the natural area.
With an index value of 3.14 units, which means a high 
biodiversity value (H’ > 3).
Based on the Mackinnon 
list (observation sheet), with the graph climbing up 
to the 17th list, this indicates the possibility of finding 
other bird species that have not been observed in the 
KPC post-mining reclamation area.
With 
a biodiversity index of 1.987 (H ‘= 1-3, biodiversity is 
classified as moderate).

BUMI’s Social Responsibility Governance
We have a social responsibility system based on a set 
of policies, vision and mission, and code of conduct.

action plan to ensure that the mining contractor 
reduces the speed of operational transportation,

Taking Steps Forwards In A Community 
Empowerment And Development Approach
In 2022, we  restructured  our  approach  strategy 
in contributing to  the  fulfillment  of  the  SDGs.
This strategy change was carried out to meet 
the expectations of stakeholders and ensure that 
BUMI’s efforts in fulfilling the SDGs can be more 
optimal.
In previous years, the Company’s efforts to 
fulfill the SDGs were based on an analysis of the 
implementation of the Company’s CSR program 
which was then linked to the objectives in the SDGs.
Aligning our business objectives with the  long- 
term interests of our stakeholders and the wider 
community is critical to BUMI’s future success.
We believe we can contribute to the United Nations 
Sustainable Development Goals by being a leader in 
the areas where we can create the greatest impact.
We make this effort as part of our commitment

The resettlement 
program started in 2005 when KPC conducted a 
Social Assessment by Ndan Imang and then KPC 
received a formal resettlement request letter from 
the community.
During the due diligence process, interviews with 
Dayak Basap reaffirmed our statement that there 
was no coercion in the resettlement process.
The resettlement 
location was decided as a result of a joint survey 
and assessment on aspects of land and water 
quality, accessibility, disaster risk, infrastructure, 
and 
socio-cultural 
conditions 
between 
the 
KPC Segading Resettlement Team and the 
Dayak Basap community in 2009.
It is recorded 
that in 2021, a total of 55 families from Segading 
Hamlet have formally agreed and/or moved to 
resettlement locations.
The technical 
operational implementation of electricity services 
and clean water supply is carried out by the Putra 
Keraitan Mandiri Village-Owned Electricity and 
Clean Water Unit (BUMDesa), which runs under 
the direct supervision and coordination of KPC.
During 2021, the realization of 
community economic empowerment activities 
includes improving agricultural infrastructure 
and making seasonal plant demonstration plots, 
funding assistance for the procurement of KWT 
Domang seasonal plant seeds, support for the 
family farming program.
In addition, KPC routinely 
conducts technical assistance and counseling in 
collaboration with the UPT Agriculture Plantation 
and Animal Husbandry of the Kutim Agriculture 
Service (UPT P4) and the Culture Village 
Empowerment Team.
