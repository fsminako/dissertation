Our 
environmental performance is 
shown below.
We have set short term 
targets for energy efficiency 
solutions and for maximizing 
renewable energy usage; 
while the medium-term 
target for 2030 is a 33% 
reduction in absolute scope 
1 and scope 2 emissions.
The long-term target is to 
achieve net zero emissions 
by 2050.
GHG Emission Calculations [POJK51-6.e.4.a]
The calculations include GHG scope 1 emissions in the 
production and usage of fuel oil (BBM), and scope 2 in 
electricity usage.
There are no calculations 
for biogenic CO2 emissions.
All GHG emission calculations 
are for operations in Sorowako, South Sulawesi.
[305-3]
GHG Emissions Intensity  [POJK51-6.e.4.a]
GHG Emissions Intensity only calculates carbon equivalent 
emissions (CO2eq), including CH4, N2O, and HFC, based on 
the total GHG scope 1 and scope 2 emission calculation.
[305-4b][305-4c][305-4d]
The GHG emission intensity in 2021 was 28.6 tons CO2eq/
ton Ni, an increase of 2% from 27.91 tons CO2eq/ton Ni 
in 2020.
This was due to a decrease in the total nickel 
in matte production and the consumption of lower 
nickel content ore when compared to 2020.
[305-5a] [305-5b] [305-5c] [305-5e]
We continue to seek opportunities to reduce GHG emissions in the 
production processes, to reduce GHG emissions of 1,800 kilotons CO2eq, or 
90% of total GHG emissions.
Other opportunities exist in the mining areas 
for a GHG emission reduction of 200 kilotons CO2eq.

conventional diesel to B20 diesel with a lower sulfur content 
in biodiesel than conventional diesel.
Particulate emissions are 
derived from the results of periodic measurements of the dryer kiln, reduction kiln, 
electric furnace and product dryer chimneys.
The particulate quality standard value 
is 0.80 Ton Particulate/Ton Ni, and the particulate concentrate measurement result 
during 2021 was 0.020 Ton Particulate/Ton Ni, meeting the quality standard.

Total energy usage in 2021 was 28,268,297 GJ, down 10% from 
30,628,679 GJ in 2020.
The largest energy source is from coal 
usage of 9,340,201 GJ, a decrease of 22% from 11,371,381 GJ 
in 2020.
The Energy Intensity in 2021 was 432.31 GJ/Ton Ni, 
higher than 424.00 GJ/Ton Ni in 2020.
This increase was due to increased fuel and coal prices, of 
12% for HSFO, 13% for HSD, and 29% for coal, respectively.

Social Impact 
Assessment [POJK51-6.c.3.a]
Our social impact assessment involves 
stakeholders in all operation areas.
We 
monitor and report the environmental 
impact management to the authorities 
through the Environmental Monitoring 
Plan (RPL), Environmental Management 
Plan (RKL), and Environmental 
Management Performance Summary 
Document (DRKPL) for PROPER 
assessment.
Stakeholder mapping covers the Sorowako, 
Bahodopi, and Pomalaa areas.
During 
2021 we continued our existing agreements 
with local communities, in accordance with 
PPM program directives and policies.
Our 
cooperation continued through the Sustainable 
Environmental Friendly Healthy Agriculture 
and Fisheries Development Program (P3SRLB 
Program) in the form of infrastructure 
development and support for the P3SRLB 
infrastructure.
For the socio-economic sector, the Company 
provided assistance and technical capacity development 
for P3SRLB cultivation for groups in the Dongi area.
The community 
empowerment program 
is the responsibility of 
the Social Development 
Program Function at 
the External Relations 
Department.
For PPM, 
we continue to build 
communication and synergy 
with the Government and 
other stakeholders.
The PPM-PKPM scope includes 
efforts to develop rural areas 
through spatial planning.
The 
impact of this approach has 
led to a growth of service 
centers, and the development 
of villages in 10 development 
areas based on superior 
potential.
The development 
areas are located in the Nuha, 
Towuti, Wasuponda, and Malili 
Districts.
Development has been 
carried out to create tourism areas, 
integrated agriculture (Agropolitan), 
pepper plantations, and commodity 
processing trading and industry 
areas.
