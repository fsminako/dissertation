It does not stop there, ITM is 
currently starting to develop digitalizing to support 
mining activities.
ITM succeeded in increasing coal 
reserves to 354.0 million tons 
with WIUP area of 80,699 ha 
by acquiring PT Nusa Persada 
Resources (NPR) in 2018.
Originated from different sites 
in Kalimantan, ITM coal has wide 
range of product specifications 
that can be mixed and combined 
based on specifications to meet 
market demands.
Owning mining and 
mining support companies directly 
increase efficiency in logistics cost 
and maximizes the value of energy 
marketing.
This position can be reflected from 
ITM’s solid ability to fulfill its short-
term obligations.
In 2018, ITM achieve 
a current ratio of 196%, liabilities to 
asset ratio of 33%, and total asset to 
liabilities of 305%.
The structure of organization and the existence of 
teams spread over a wide geographical range affect 
the promptness of decision making and the limited 
access to information.
ITM addressed this challenge 
by optimistically investing in digital transformation or 
digitalization.
In a further stage, digitalization developed by ITM will 
focus on:
a.
Making Control Room a single source of accurate 
information to monitor performance on site 
compared to short-term targets and performance 
indicators.
c.	
Optimizing coal supply between production and 
sales contracts through STSC (Short-Term Supply 
Chain).
Through digitalization development, 
ITM hopes to increase the procurement 
process of goods and services, 
the availability of information for 
suppliers, and include an assessment 
of quality and price aspects in the 
selection process of heavy equipment 
procurement.
ITM’s coal production in 2018 reached 98% of target.
In the coming year, ITM 
will prepare for the development of digitalization in 
purchasing and storing fuel to optimize costs.
Some of the 
activities are monitoring the Road 
Gradient, adding motor graders, 
changing the composition and 
replacing hauling fleet to a larger 
capacity of 150 tons.
Through 
these activities, TRUST can save 
fuel costs up to Rp32.3 billion 
during 2018.
The development of PLN 
electricity grid in the port area 
of PT Kitadin-Embalut (EMB) 
has managed to reduce 25% 
(Rp64.3 million) of generator set 
operating costs for 6 months.

its contractors.
Fuel Pooling secures fuel supply for 
ITM and all contractors at operational 
sites.
Local Business Partners in the Supply Chain
In line with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral 
Resources Regulation No.28 of 2009, ITM supports 
the absorption of local revenue by prioritizing local 
suppliers and contractors in its procurement of goods 
and services.
Of the total registered suppliers and 
contractors, 97.3% of them originated from Indonesia 
with a contract value of 99.0% of total value in 
procurement of goods and services.
ITM has employed local workforce based on point of 
hire from the mining operations area in Kalimantan.
In line with the type of industry, ITM has customers 
based on long-term and short-term agreements.

ITM implements In-Pit Crushing & Conveying 
(IPCC) system for secured transportation 
mileage.
Through this procedure, 
we ensure the quality of the product, so there 
is no product recalled.
ITM 
implements HSEMS through Department of Health, 
Safety, Environment and Community Development 
(HSEC) and supported by CSR Department, and 
earned ISO 14001: 2015 certification which is an 
international standard in environmental management.
ITM’s commitment in effort to restore and preserve the 
environment is realized by providing environmental 
expenditure.
The total environmental expenditures in 
2018 reached USD26.4 millions.
This post-mining 
activities aim to create benefits and independence for 
the surrounding community.
In 2018, JBG conducted pit optimization to gain an 
additional 8.6 million tons of proven reserves and 9.8 
million tons of estimated reserves (end of 2018).
This 
finding prompted the Government to issue a policy to 
continue the process of mining permit extension until 
2026.
In bids to improve post-mining 
environmental conditions, ITM conducted post-mining 
habitat recovery with reclamation activities.
Until the end of 2018, ITM conducted 
reclamation on an accumulative area of 12,028 ha.

Conservation 
efforts were carried out in collaboration with the 
Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI) and the 
Technical Service Unit (UPT) of Purwodadi Botanical 
Garden.
This book is the result 
of Indonesian Institute of Science LIPI’s research on 
conservation of plant diversity in pre-mining areas of 
subsidiaries PT BEK and PT IMM during 2010-2017.
In 
2019, this book on biodiversity will be disseminate to 
universities in East Kalimantan.
This activity was 
carried out as an effort to restore, maintain and 
improve the function of the watershed as the life 
support system.

and Education Forest, Mulawarman 
University (TCM and BEK).
The handover of watershed land that was considered 
successful has made IMM as the largest IPPKH holder 
that handed over the result of Watershed rehabilitation 
in Indonesia.
PT ITM has a policy standard to involve 
local communities in these planting activities as 
provider of planting services or through community 
empowerment programs.
It is planned to be submitted 
by IMM of 3,000 ha, KTD TDM of 900 ha, and JBG of 
279 ha.
High rainfall at the mine site affects the operating 
hours and can reduce the amount of coal produced.
If this condition occurs, there will be a 2% risk of not 
meeting the 2018 production target.
To overcome this situation, 64 settling ponds with a 
capacity of 7.3 million m3 serve as an effort to control 
water runoff.
Through processing of settling ponds, ITM 
has succeeded in utilizing runoff for watering roads, 
vehicles and mining facilities, and stockpile spraying.
Until the end of the reporting period, the intensity of 
water consumption reached 0.24 m3/ton, increased 
from 2017 which reached 0.23 m3/ton.
This increase 
was due to the activity expansion of subsidiary, PT 
TRUST, in hauling transportation.
ITM actively monitors the effluent quality from mining 
to activities in the port area.

generators and electricity from PLN.
In compliance with Minister of Energy and Mineral 
Resources (ESDM) Regulation No.12 of 2015, ITM 
support the utilization of renewable energy by 
participating the Biodiesel Mandatory Program.
The usage of diesel started in fourth 
quarter of 2018.
Note: Energy sources of ITM and its Contractors were calculated jointly because the pooling of diesel fuel and 
power plant in mining concession areas was directly managed by ITM.

• Biogenic emission begin to be calculated in 2018, in line with the commencement of biodiesel utilization.
The revised calculation indicated the amount 
of emissions that cover all diesel fuel consumption in 
each subsidiary.
This caused the amount of emissions 
generated from diesel fuel source to increase by 62% 
compared to the previous year with emission intensity 
of 0.11 tons of CO2eq/ton of production.
ITM continued the effort to control GHG emissions, 
both through energy efficiency and tree planting in all 
operating areas.
Up to 2018, the planted trees reached 
6.6 million trees and contributed greatly to carbon 
absorption.
With baseline calculations of 2012, ITM 
managed to reduce emissions by 24.6% in 2018.
Management of effluent is carried out through settling 
ponds and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP).
Runoff water is regularly processed and monitored 
to meet the quality standards set by the government 
before finally being discharged to water bodies.

rearranges 
the 
governance 
of 
community 
empowerment in the mineral and coal sector.
This 
policy prompted ITM to align the the Community 
Development program (CD) implementation which 
referred to the blueprint.
The preparation of this blueprint involved all 
stakeholders.
In line with the Ministerial Decree, ITM formulated 
a master plan for Community Development and 
Empowerment (PPM) program as a roadmap in each 
ITM operating site in implementing the PPM program.
Unlike the programs in 2017 which only covered 6 CD 
sectors, in 2018 PPM program has been adjusted and 
developed into 8 PPM sectors.
The drafting of PPM master plan began with social 
mapping in 43 fostered villages based on PPM 
blueprint from provincial and decree of the Minister 
of ESDM No.
This master plan is then 
consulted with local government, from both provincial 
and district.
Compliance to the decree of minister of ESDM 
No.1824, ITM allocated PPM budget based on the life 
of mine planning.
Through this calculation, the coal 
production volume up to the mine closure can be 
estimated to determine the proportion of the PPM 
budget.
During 2018, ITM has implemented the 347 activites 
related to PPM Program with the involvement of 
local communities.

health through clean water management facilities 
that are carried out in stages.
The clean water 
program is gradually managed independently by the 
community with operations are carried out through 
Village-Owned Enterprises (BUMDes) as clean water 
committee.
The gradual shift of management by the 
community is expected to foster a strong sense of 
ownership in the community, which is expected the 
infrastructure that has been built can be maintained.
Programs of Economic Development and Employment 
aim to develop PPM by optimizing local potentials in 
an effort to boost community income.
