COVID-19 Mitigation.
We consider that operational activities carried out 
by business units pose a high safety and health 
risk for workers.
As a pioneer in occupational health and safety, we 
are taking steps forward to ensure the health and 
safety of employees and their families through 
regular screening (PCR/rapid test antigen/antibody 
rapid test).
Aturan  work from home  (WFH).
During 2021, the work programs for overcoming 
exposure to COVID-19 that we have successfully 
implemented are:
1.
Provision of masks and hand sanitizers in the work 
area.
Encourage employees and management 
to maintain personal hygiene and the work 
environment.
Rules for delaying the service.
Rest and work at home rules for employees.
If 
any employee’s family shows signs of contracting 
COVID-19, the employee is required to work from 
home and report the developmental condition and 
doctor’s diagnosis to the head of their respective 
department.
Work from home (WFH) rules.
In the midst of the pandemic, the high price of coal is a blessing for the company.
This profit was obtained from revenue which grew up to 27.55% or USD 1.008 
billion compared to 2020 which was USD 790.4 million.
For debt 
maturing in 2022, we are exploring to restructure 
debt so as to reduce the amount of interest expense 
faced by the company.
Prima, superior quality coal, with high calorie, very low ash content, medium sulfur content with low 
moisture.
Pinang, has lower calories than Prima with a higher humidity level.
The 
coal is broken down, separated and then washed to 
reduce its ash content in order to increase its selling 
price.

By the end of 2021, KPC had actively and routinely 
made efforts to manage the quality of wastewater.
Routine measurement and management of water 
quality parameters revealed that the quality of 
the water released into water bodies met 100% 
of the quality standards set by applicable laws 
and regulations.
At the end of 2021, KPC had 
55 management points, comprising of 37 mine 
wastewater compliance points, 7 wastewater to the 
sea management points and 11 domestic wastewater 
compliance points.
Results indicated that the water 
quality at all monitoring locations was satisfactory 
during 2021.
Kaltim Prima Coal (KPC) PKP2B area covers ± 849.38 
km2, covering the Sangatta and Bengalon mines, 
with geographic boundaries between 117o27’7.40”- 
117o 40’43.40” east longitude and 0o31’20.52”- 
0o52’4, 60”.
The PKP2B KPC areas are in the North 
Sangatta, Bengalon and Kaubun Districts on the 
north side, while in the southern part they are in the 
Kecamatan Sangatta Selatan and Rantau Pulung.
At each stage of the activity, impact management 
actions are carried to manage the impact so that it 
is safe and in accordance with the rules.
The plant species planted 
in the reclamation area are selected based on the 
land cover function which is in accordance with 
their designation.
In 2021, the area of land cleared by KPC was 1,638.64 
hectares with a cumulative area of 32,279.93 
hectares, while the rehabilitation area was 1,683.79 
hectares, a minor decrease from the previous year 
which was 1,697.48 hectares with a cumulative area 
in 2021 reaching 13,309.70 hectares.
The number 
of trees planted was 1,288,796, an increase from 
1,167,254 in the previous year.
On the other hand, by the end of 2021 the total area 
of land that Arutmin had cleared for mining activities 
and its supporting facilities reached approximately 
16,498.3 hectares.
The cumulative ratio of 
land that has been laid out to clear was 56.2%, while 
the ratio of revegetated land to the total open area 
was 50.8%.
During 2021, 
planting was carried out in a river basin area of 
approximately 1,590.3 hectares with 1,326,310 trees 
and a cumulative area up to 2021 covering 2,816.2 
hectares with a total of 2,348,711 trees.
The species 
of rehabilitated plants in the river basin area include 
jambu mete, kemiri, rubber, jengkol, petai, eucalyptus, 
mangsoni, angsana and gaharu.
The watershed 
rehabilitation area is located in Banjar District, Tanah 
Laut and Tanah Bumbu, South Kalimantan Province.
The 
number of natural tree species and revegetation 
that results in the 16 reclamation areas varied 
considerably.
The presence of understorey species in 
the post-mining reclamation area is very important, 
because it can invite wild animals to find food and seek 
shelter.
The value of tree biodiversity is moderate, 
that is 1-3.
In addition, there are 54 species of birds in the KPC 
post-mining reclamation area, this number is more 
than the natural area.
With an index value of 3.14 units, 
which means a high biodiversity value (H’ > 3).
Based 
on the Mackinnon list (observation sheet), with the 
graph climbing up to the 17th list, this indicates the 
possibility of finding other bird species that have not 
been observed in the KPC post-mining reclamation 
area.
With 
a biodiversity index of 1.987 (H ‘= 1-3, biodiversity is 
classified as moderate).

Arutmin’s Asamasam 
Mine implemented an initiative to conserve the 
habitat of the bekantan in the Asamasam Village.
The 
population of the bekantan in the Asamasam village is 
relatively large, but it is not supported with adequate 
food source.
Until now, the 
number of sambar deer in captivity consists of 9 
female deer and 4 male deer with the longest horns 
of 50 cm.
This area has 5 species of coral reefs.
