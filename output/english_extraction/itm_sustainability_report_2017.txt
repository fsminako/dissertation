Logistics Cost Optimization
With the acquisition of PT Gasemas (PTGE) in 2017, a fuel 
distributor, ITM managed to secure a more optimal energy 
supply.
ITM’s significant reduction of logistics cost in the supply 
chain was achieved by optimizing the contractor business 
service of subsidiary (TRUST), step change program, and 
development of Information Technology (IT).
ITM addressed 
this by focusing on productivity and cost rationalization to 
maintain a sustainable company value.
More efficient cost management, enabling the Company 
to distribute a stable economic value to maintain a positive 
business margin.
The Step Change program was set up in order to increase competitiveness of the core business by reducing costs and streamlining 
operations.
The saving value is amounted to 25.8 million USD, higher than the saving plan of 8.3 million USD.
The Mine Geographic Information System was developed in 2017 to facilitate employees in mapping the area, coordinates, and location of 
vegetation land, land clearing, and other mining activities.
The In-Pit Crushing & Conveying (IPCC) system is a mining process that combines semi-mobile crusher, conveyor, and spreader for efficient 
works in management and transportation of ground cover.
IPCC implementation can reduce the cost of transporting overburden to increase 
stripping ratio and indirectly increase the amount of reserves that can be mined.
In addition, the process is more environmentally friendly 
and safe facilitated with Coal-Fired Power Plant, and reduce the necessity of transportation activities.
Source from Audited Consolidated Income Statements.
The economic performance figures cover all subsidiaries; IMM, TCM, BEK, KTD, JBG, TIS, ITMI, IBU, IEU, TIS, IBP, TRUST, PTGE.
Financial information can not be presented by region, marketing area, or other criteria.
This strategic implementation refers to 
the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources Regulation 
No.28 of 2009 that supports the transfer of knowledge, 
development of local workforce, and the absorption of 
regional income.
ITM and its registered partners have empowered local 
workers from Kalimantan based on point of hire.
In 2017, 
workers from regions empowered by ITM reached 2,130 
employees and 12% of them managed to occupy the 
position of operational leader and above.
Of the total number of registered vendors and contractors, 
97.3% of them are from Indonesia with contract value 
reaching 99.0% of the total value of goods and services 
procurement.
CMS enables ITM to create standardized and comprehensive safety recording and work quality.
Benchmarks include policy, planning, 
implementation, monitoring, to management reviews.
Pooling fuel secures fuel supply for ITM and all contractors at operational sites.
The Community Development Forum synergizes the community empowerment program undertaken by ITM subsidiaries and all its 
contractors.
The 
implementation of comprehensive quality management 
starts from mining, transportation, storage and processing, 
up to shipment stage.
Strategy to Maintain Market Position:
1.
Marketing blending coal that has its own specifications 
and derivatives to expand the target market.
Managing diversified sales and trading of coal with long-
term contracts and on-spot markets.
Provide total services including coal usage and emissions 
at customer power plants
4.
Accept quality improvement suggestions from customers
5.
During 2017, ITM conducted management and monitoring by applying 
technology and innovation to minimize environmental impact.
The hard work 
was recognized by the Ministry of the Environment in the form of a Blue Proper 
award received by JBG, TCM, and Kitadin Site Embalut.
To optimize matters related to post-mining, 
ITM established an organization focused on mine closure 
activities and led by the Mining Technical Head in 2016.
This 
organization was in charge for the implementation of the 
Post-mining Plan (RPT) document that has been approved 
by the Government.
Compliance with legal aspects of post-mining activities based on letter of East Kutai Regent No.540/857.1/Distamben-PU/VIII/2014 and 
has been communicated to stakeholders.
The fulfillment of employee welfare is carried out primarily by the policy of entrepreneurship training for all employees.
In addition, 417 
employees had career opportunities at other companies under the ITM group.

Of the total of ITM mining business license area that has 
been operating, Company has put in place a conservation 
plan for biodiversity in subsidiaries of BEK and IMM.
We 
cooperate with Technical Service Unit (UPT) of Purwodadi 
Botanical Garden under the management of Indonesian 
Institute of Sciences (LIPI).
“During 2017 we planted 1.9 million trees, consisted of local plants grown in forest areas.
Until 
the end of 2017, there were trees such as Meranti trees (Shorea Balangeran), Gaharu (Aquilaria 
malacensis), Ulin (Eusideroxylon swager), Nyatoh (Palaquium walsurifolium), Kapur (Dryobalanop 
lanciolata), and other local plants”.
Hereinafter to be submitted once 
again to a district stakeholder for further development.
Especially in 2017, ITM through its subsidiary, IMM has 
conducted watershed planting activities in forest area East 
Kalimantan with area of 600 ha submitted to head of Kutai 
National Park.
Operate 62 settling ponds with a capacity of 8.1 million m3 
as outlets to control erosion, retain water, sedimentation, 
and process water flow for reuse and discharge.
Periodically dredge sedimentation ponds and place 
dredged results in coal stockpiling
4.
This challenge 
was again a concern in 2017.
High and prolonged rainfall 
has caused delays in operational hours and reduced coal 
deposits.
Unfavorable rainfall caused unmet production targets, 
which was 14% lower than the previous year.
Water Management  
With the abundant of rainwater, ITM managed to utilize it 
as processed water source for watering road, vehicles and 
mining facilities, and spraying in stockpiles.
In 2017, the 
reuse of runoff processed by settling ponds reached 4.1 
million m3.
Until the end 
of the reporting year, water consumption in some activities 
decreased with post-mining at KTD Tandung Mayang, 
decreased production due to long rainy weather, and cost 
rationalization policy.
By 2017, the water intensity reached 
0.22 m3/ton, 29% more efficient than the previous year.
While most of electricity was met by diesel generators.
The 
remaining were supplied by electricity from state power 
company PLN for JBG operation, gasoline and diesel to 
support other supporting activity.
Intensity of energy 
usage in 2017 increased by 27%.
The increase of energy 
usage was resulted due to the change of energy calculation 
method, which starting to include the calorific value of coal 
for power plant and usage of diesel for barge activity.
Processed effluent management from domestic activity 
ensures that water discharge to the water body does not 
exceed the established quality standard and does not affect 
the ecosystem in the water source.
Energy sources of ITM and its Contractors were calculated jointly because the pooling of diesel fuel and power plant in mining 
concession areas was directly managed by ITM.

Emission load calculation system refers to Minister of Environment 
Regulation No.
The Flue Gas Desulfurization (FGD) system controls and monitors 
emissions regularly.
Monitoring system for emissions from ports, coal processing facilities 1-3, 
and other facilities.
Gases included in GHG calculation are CO2, CH4, N2O, and HFCs.
With baseline on 2012, ITM 
have achieved GHG emission reduction for 27.8% till 2017 
and exceed our target of 25% by 2020.
This increase was due to the change of calculation method 
for GHG emission based on energy consumed in operationg 
activities; mining, supporting, blasting and open pit.
This 
change caused the GHG emission calculation in 2017 began 
to include the amount of emission generated from the gases 
of Carbon Dioxide (CO2), Methane (CH4), Nitrous Oxide 
(N2O), and Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)  which is the residue 
of blasting and open pit activity.
Waste Management
In general, all effluent from mining activities is processed 
through settling ponds.
As for solid waste is managed by the 
3Rs principle; reduce, reuse, and recycle.
Recording of amount, storage procedure, and waste 
treatment are conducted  by ITM based on SOP and 
supervised by HSE Department.
By 2017, the total utilization of B3 waste reached 35% of all waste generated.
The Company implements ITM HR Strategy which aims to ensure welfare, 
improve competence and performance of human resources in accordance with 
its vision and mission.
Through an integrated ITM HR Strategy, the Company 
coordinates the management of employees at all 
subsidiaries.
To develop HR operational excellence in serving our customers with proactive, accurate and consistency quality of service.
The HR Framework translates the Company’s vision and mission into organizational design and strategy of corporate culture.
All HR work processes are based on competence starting from the employee 
selection and hiring process, training and development, up to employee career development.
BANPU Spirit Survey Score >80% and enhancing Innovation Committee’s Role
3.
HR development process is based on competency requirements consisting of core, leadership and functional competencies.
Implementation of Banpu Spirit Culture
The policy on upholding work culture begins with the 
compliance of the Code of Ethics or Code of Conduct that 
guides the management and all ITM employees.
The work 
culture implementation demonstrates the integration 
of employee attitudes and behaviors in meeting global 
compliance and standards.
Honest, ethical, trustworthy and 
reliable, disciplined, persistent, 
committed, and transparent.
Cooperative and collaborative, fairminded, 
teamwork, networking, supportive and sharing, 
strive for win-win.
Banpu Spirit Training is to activate the 5 powers inside each employee to apply the core values that will be the basis of employee 
behavior in the company.
The measurement of corporate culture implementation is carried out annually by both online and offline surveys for quantitative 
measurement and discussion forums (FGDs) for qualitative measures.
Based on Banpu Spirit Survey 2017, Banpu Spirit’s understanding 
reached 81.5%.
Diversity In Equality 
In addition to employees working in DKI Jakarta Head 
Office, all employees, both in the mining and supporting 
businesses scattered in the provinces of East Kalimantan, 
Central Kalimantan, and South Kalimantan have the same 
rights and obligations, in accordance with the position level.
We include equal work opportunity in the company 
regulation (PP) and Collective Labor Agreement (CLA) which 
complies with the Equal Employment Opportunities (EEO) 
principle.
Until the end of 2017, the employee composition has more 
male employees due to business conditions in the mining 
industry that requires a lot of experts in the field.
The number of employees at the placement locations is calculated based on the Mining Business License Area (WIUP), fulfilling the requirements of the recording of 
occupational accidents and other calculations.
ITM has a number of benefits, facilities, and programs 
for employees dedicated to supporting excellent working 
conditions and harmonious working relationships.
Employee Benefit Fulfillment
In line with the Company’s principle to provide equal opportunity 
for each employee, we do not distinguish the amount of 
employee benefits between the male and female employees.
The lowest of minimum wage provided by company has reach 
102% of provincial minimum wage.
Differences occur due to 
employment status, performance assessment, position/job and 
duration of work in accordance with applicable provisions and 
collective labor agreement (CLA).
Welfare for Retirees
Based on the HR Policy, the Company pays close attention 
to employees who are retiring at the age of 55 years.
During 
2017, ITM organized precondition for 19 employees in the 
form of employee benefits and entrepreneurship training.
Development of Competency Standards 
An important factor that influences employee evaluation 
and career development outcomes is the fulfillment of 
competency 
standards.
Registered employees are not required to work and be mentally prepared for business and receive some benefits from Social Security.
This preconditions begins with mental preparation, 
financial management, health, dissemination of pension rights, and entrepreneurship training participated through visits to successful 
businesses.
This policy is expected to trigger the spirit of entrepreunership after retirement.
Entering 2017, ITM improves the quality of HR Information 
System implementation with information technology 
training.
OHS Management System 
ITM realizes the efforts to implement an integrated OHS 
program at the entire work areas by adopting Safety 
Management System for Mining Industry and OHS 
management system.
The OHS management system is 
carried out by the Department of Quality, Safety, and 
Environment.
Memenuhi aspek keselamatan operasional pertambangan baik sarana, prasarana, instalasi dan peralatan	
	
In compliance to safety standards for mining’s facilities, infrastructure, installations, and equipmenets.
The implementation of Mining Safety Management System 
and OHS management system begins with raising the
