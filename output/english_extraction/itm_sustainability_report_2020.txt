Environmental Management System
ITM menerapkan pengelolaan lingkungan, termasuk 
pascatambang berdasarkan pemetaan dampak 
terhadap lingkungan dan penerapan Sistem Manajemen 
Kesehatan dan Kecelakaan Kerja & Lingkungan 
(SMK3L), serta ISO14001:2015 Sistem Manajemen 
Lingkungan.
Environmental management is handled by the 
Department of Health, Safety, Environment and 
Community Development (HSEC) and is carried out in 
an integrated manner with other functions, including 
the CSR Department.
In 2020, the Company realized USD11.9 million in 
funds to support environmental management.
Post-mining activities include revegetation as 
part of reclamation activities.
Until the end of 
2020, plant maintenance activities reached 234.97 Ha 
area in the post-mining reclamation land of TDM that 
had been reforested.
The total carbon sequestration in 
the reclamation area of TDM in 2020 reached 8,499.49 
tons of CO2.
The activities of  material 
backfilling in the void area has reduced 30 ha of the 
total area of voids or decreased by 40% from the 
previous void area.
Subsequently, revegetation activities 
were carried out in the area.
[304-2]
The impact of changes in natural landscape due 
to mining operations is the emergence of habitat 
variations, such as areas of reclamation, mining, 
settling pond, and other areas temporarily.
Pile top soil in a safe place from erosion or mining activities.
Plant cover crop of CP
, CM, and Muccun to control the drift of top soil by runoff and 
     maintain soil fertility.
Apply mining method of back filling or in pit dump.
Adjust the slope to mine safety design.
Applying the mining method, back filling or in pit dump.
Changes in landscape, 
increased erosion rates and 
increased sedimentation

Planting the cover crop to manage the surface water flow and increase soil fertility.
Planting fast growing plants and local plants to restore ecological functions.
Maintaining and monitoring the revegetated plants growth.
By the end of 2020, ITM had planted 
8,326,455 trees on a total land area of 13,394 Ha.
The 
planted trees consisted of local plant species and 
economic plants.
The local plants planted included 
Mangifera casturi, Eusideroxylon zwageri, and Shorea 
balangeran.
In 2020, 
ITM’s collaboration with the Indonesian Institute of 
Sciences (LIPI) and the Technical Operating Unit of 
Plant Conservation Center (UPTBKT) at the Purwodadi 
Botanical Garden for biodiversity studies at IMM, TCM 
and BEK faced hurdles   due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Based on the biodiversity index study conducted, ITM 
have mapped endemic species and endemic plants 
listed on the IUCN Red List.
In addition, in mining 
areas managed by BEK, ITM allocated 30 Ha as a 
conservation area or 0.17% of the total 17,311 Ha 
mining area.
Cover crop planting of 33.5 Ha has been carried out and planting 
of fast-growing vegetation in 103.17 Ha of protected forest.
• Activities of uprooting seedlings from the conservation area 
with a total production of 7,338 uprooted plants from the forest.
• Reclamation of 82.52 Ha with 52,121 plants planted and a total 
of 23 types of plants.
Monitoring of flora and fauna diversity in the Galam Forest by a 
research team from the University of Lambung Mangkurat.
The 
monitoring results recorded of 42 types of flora and 39 types of 
fauna.
Based on Decree of the Minister of Forestry No.
SK.8671/MenLHK-PDASHL/KTA/DAS.1/12/218 
dated December  18, 2018, IPPKH holders are obliged 
to carry out watershed rehabilitation for an area at the 
size of concession area in their permit.
The invasive species found 
are weeds and acacia trees.
Note: The number of trees planted and handed over reached more than 11 million trees.
This estimated calculation takes into account the different
planting patterns, both intensively with a minimum of 1,100 trees/ha and enrichment with 625 trees/ha.
Watershed land that has been handed over 
of 7,540 ha is the accumulation of IMM a total of 6,640 ha and KTD a total of 900 ha.
On September 14, 2020, IMM handed over 3,040 
hectares of planted land  to the government.
The 
handover was conducted during a webinar event to 
adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic conditions.
The 
handover was made by the President Director of IMM to 
the Director General of Watershed and Protected Forest 
Management (PDASHL), Ministry of Environment and 
Forestry (KLHK).
The watershed that have 
been rehabilitated and handed over to the government 
in 2020 located in Melawan area, which is part of 
the Kutai National Park (TNK) area.
The preservation of coastal areas is carried 
out through subsidiary IMM, with the community’s 
involvement in mangrove planting and coral reefs 
transplantation.
The selection of mangroves was based on the results 
of Indonesian Intitute of Sciences (LIPI)’s publication 
that found mangrove forests in Indonesia are capable 
of absorbing 52.85 tons of CO2/Ha/year, higher than the 
global estimate (26.42 tons of CO2/Ha/year).
Mangrove 
planting is expected to strengthen the potential for 
carbon sequestration in Kalimantan.
Until the end of 2020, the mangrove planting area 
has reached 35 hectares.
The volume of electricity 
generated by the hybrid power plant in 2020 reached 
30,815 MW.
The Company regularly conducts internal energy 
audits, and the results of energy audits are verified by 
a certified independent party.
In 2020, an energy audit 
was carried out at ITM’s subsidiary, JBG.
• 
Utilizing water as a power turbine for a quick limes 
mixer in mine effluent management.
• 
Utilizing water at the outlet of the WWM 16 
settling pond as a source of lighting in the water 
management area.
ITM has developed renewable energy by applying 
microgrid solutions to ensure a sustainable electricity 
supply, to support mining operations at the sites 
managed by IMM, in Bontang, East Kalimantan.
This system is projected to produce 230 
MWh of solar energy from Photovoltaic (PV) each year, 
which capable of reducing CO2 emissions by 192 tons.
The 
calculation method is adjusted to the emission source.
Through calculation of the volume of GHG emissions, 
ITM prepares the plan and controls the level of GHG 
emissions that will be generated.
The total volume 
of GHG emissions in 2020 was 1,666,284 Tons CO2-eq, 
17.3% lower than in 2019 which reached 1,955,277 
Tons Tons CO2-eq.

[303-4] 
ITM’s mining operations are supported by 69 settling 
ponds with a capacity of 17.21 million m3, which has 
been designed to deal with climate change, such as 
weather anomalies and high rainfall.
The settling ponds 
are capable of controlling and treating rainwater runoff.
ITM monitors rivers as destination water bodies to 
which effluent is discharged.
Monitoring is carried out 
to ensure the quality of the treated effluent so as not 
to pollute the river.
Effluent processing is carried out in 
settling ponds and wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) 
from mine management.
The total volume of treated 
effluent discharged into water bodies reached 1,363.53 
million m3.
The monitoring is conducted 
by an accredited laboratory.
The monitoring results 
found that the quality of treated effluent discharged 
to water bodies has met the quality standards set by 
the government.
The results of monitoring and calculation 
found no impact on the discharge of treated effluent 
does not affect the habitat in the river body.
