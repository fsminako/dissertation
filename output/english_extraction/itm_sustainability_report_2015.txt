In 
addition, Risk Management Unit conducts regular workshops 
to introduce and communicate risk management concepts 
and practices to Risk Coordinators, who are carrying out 
both operational and support functions.
Some of 
the risks are:
1.
Risk mitigation:
- 
Ensuring compliance with regulations at the local, 
regional, and national levels, including the fulfillment 
of obligations and post-mining reclamation through 
rehabilitation and revegetation.
• 
Conflict of Interest
	
Potential conflicts of interest between the Company 
and members of the Board of Directors are minimized 
by the fulfillment of the obligation to disclose 
information to regulators and the public.
The scope of areas audited comprise 
of ITM business processes (including supporting and 
overhead functions at head office) and all of its subsidiaries 
(including mining and port operations).
The whistleblower’s interest 
will be safeguarded at all times.
In order to support this 
system, ITM has developed different channel such as PO 
BOX to encourage offline reports.
During 2015, ITM had received a total of 10 reports 
which have been handled by the Ombudsman and the 
Investigation Committee in accordance with set procedures.
The theme was chosen as 
it is related with changes in the IT area and information 
security.
In order to fully embrace ISO 
26000 into organization, we have established implementation 
blue print and key milestones for 5 years onward.
This integrated grievance center is a channel where stakeholders 
(e.g.
can voice their concerns and/or complaints and ITM can resolve 
those complaints as early and effectively as possible based on 
GCG Principles and avoid any undue escalation.
VoiS is a system which is developed and maintained internally by 
ITM for resolving grievances based on ITM’s Grievance Handling 
Policy & Procedure.
We have equipped the VoiS mechanism with the appropriate policy, 
procedure and facilities.
We aim to launch VoiS 
mechanism for our external stakeholders before the end of 2016.
ITM’s citizens are the engine of the Company’s sustainability.
Should all the requirements and 
selection criteria be met, ITM prioritizes the enrollment of 
prospective employees from that local areas.

continue receiving their rights as employees.
Employee Engagement [G4-11]
ITM establishes relationships based based on mutual 
respect with its employees, providing a balance of 
fulfillment of employees’ rights and the execution of 
obligations.
Intensive communication and involvementin the 
bipartite forum, between the Company’s management and 
ITM’s citizen as represented by labor unions, are of equal

1.
Improving the quality of the electricity network.
Our total 
energy consumption, encompassing all ITM production and 
operational activities in 2015, amounted to 9,513,964.09 GJ.
We 
managed to reduce our total energy consumption by 35.27% 
compared to the previous year, exceeding the lower coal 
production from 29.1 million tonnes to 28.5 million tonnes.
ITM managed to reduce our energy intensity requirement 
in producing our coal through a variety of energy efficiency 
efforts conducted at all our production chain.
Our energy intensity this 
year was recorded at 333,823.30 GJ/ton coal or 34% more 
efficient compare to the previous year energy intensity which 
recorded at 505,056.32 GJ/ton.
ITM conducts 
direct measurements to monitor it’s water usage quality.
As evidence of this, by the end 
of 2015 there were no complaints from the surrounding 
communities related to the decrease in the quantity river 
water or ground water due to our water consumption for 
operation.
To begin with, ITM withdraws groundwater from wells or rivers.
[G4-DMA]
In particular, ITM conducts regular emissions control on our 
heavy equipment and operational vehicles.
This practice is 
in line with the Regulation of the Minister of Environment 
No.
In 2015, results from testing revealed that chemical 
compounds released from our mining and operational 
activities were below the required parameters.
In 2013, ITM 
has conducted measure its green house gas emissions in 
ton CO2e.
The wastes are 
classified into solid, liquid, hazardous/toxic and general wastes.
Items considered as solid waste include secondhand scrap 
metal, conveyor belts, batteries, tyres and fly ash.
For fly ash, which is a type of hazardous 
and toxic waste, PT Indominco Mandiri has obtained
