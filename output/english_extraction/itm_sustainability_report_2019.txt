The Mining activities in the Melak Cluster begin 
with coordination at the MDC Morning Meeting to 
determine priorities and daily targets based on the pit 
conditions.
Monitoring and follow-up to the contractors can 
be effected quickly by the internal MDC team through 
short digital messages.
In addition, the movement, speed, and transport 
capacity of each truck from the Run of Mine (ROM) to 
the crusher at Bunyut Port can be monitored visually 
and in real-time through the Coal Hauling Tracking 
(CHaT) dashboard.
Watching the dashboard, the 
team can visually directly assess the  production 
performance.
The 
implementation of these initiatives has saved up to 
USD 36 million.

the watershed rehabilitation programme.
ITM engaged the community to develop a watershed area with a 
composition of 75% of staple plants and 25% of intercrops that have 
economic value for the community.
This is in line with the program 
of the regional government of Kutai Kartanegara regulated in LHK 
Regulation No.

No.P
.89 of 2016 concerning guidelines for planting watersheds.
Determine the area that will be crossed of the watershed area for the 
Samarinda-Balikpapan toll road.
The surrender of watershed land which was 
considered successful made IMM the holder of IPPKH 
and the largest rehabilitation of a watershed area in 
Indonesia.
The 4,700 ha of watershed land has been 
prepared to be handed over in 2020.
To respond to these 
challenge, ITM, in accordance with the related laws, 
has carried out a watershed management system.
The purpose of ITM’s presence in critical watersheds 
is to rehabilitate the function of forests in the 
watershed area.
This rehabilitation manages the 
ecological impact of soils and invasive species 
that are identified as reversible.
This challenge has been identified by ITM and 
managed by increasing soil fertility in the planted 
areas with certified organic fertilizer.
In the future, this 
ecosystem will host again fruit trees and invite native 
fauna such as Orang Utan and Proboscis monkeys.
This job conducted by involving lokal contractor in 
oder to create entrepreneurship and employment by 
providing the plant seed.
In the future the Company 
believes that rehabilitation will convert back critical 
land to its original forest functions in the future.
Note: The number of trees planted and handed over reached more than 11 million trees.
Upstream of the Ciliwung river, ITM has 
collaborated with the Ciliwung Puncak 
Rungkun Awi Community, which consists of 
local volunteers to carry out the Tree Fostering 
program.
In 2019, there were be 50 employee 
participated in fostering programs for 100 tree 
seedlings consisting of typical tree species 
such as coffee, bamboo and fruit trees 
multipurpose tree species.
These efforts will increase water 
absorption rates in the watershed in the future 
and reduce the potential for flooding in the 
downstream areas.
The preservation of the coastal area is carried out 
through a subsidiary of IMM by planting mangrove 
and conducting coral reef rehabilitation activities.
