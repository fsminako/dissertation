Economic Performance
The condition of the coal industry in 2013 was, overall, still less than conducive, characterized by falling average 
prices for coal as a result of weak global demand.  As a result, ITM strove to achieve measured operational 
efficiencies to maintain profit margins in the midst of falling average product prices in the global market.  As a 
result, the reduction in ITM’s income was held to approximately 11%.  The fall in net profit was also able to be held 
at approximately 47%.  
ITM also made more intensive use of its Human Resources’ competencies in the process of improving operational 
support equipment and intensified the use of domestically produced components of an equivalent quality, with the 
guarantee of continued availability.  Through these methods, the Company strove to maintain the profit margin per 
ton of coal sold.

shareholders, but also has a positive influence on the stakeholders. More detailed information on the Company’s 
financial performance can be seen in the ITM 2013 Annual Report. 
CONTRIBUTION TO THE STATE
Every year, the Company makes a contribution to the state in the form of taxes, royalties (exploitation fees), 
retribution, and import duties. The total tax paid to the state in 2013 amounted to US$90.5 million, down from 
the tax payment in 2012 of US$159.1 million. Royalties (exploitation fees) in 2013 reached a total US$266.0 
million, down 13% from the US$305.3 million in 2012. These reductions resulted from the decreased in average 
sales price.

2013 Sustainability Report
Total contributions paid by the Company to the state 
in the reporting year amounted to US$356.4 million, 
a reduction of 23% from the contribution of US$464.3 
million in 2012. 
In addition to contributing financially, the Company 
also made material contributions in the form of facility 
and infrastructure construction. 
1.	 Construction of a meeting hall in Danau Redan 
village and a Village Office in Sukarahmat village in 
East Kutai. 
2.	 Construction of roads for Penarong, Empas, Lotaq 
and Jengan Danum villages (West Kutai), as well as 
roads for Separi, Kertabuana, Embalut and Bangun 
Rejo villages (Kutai Kertanegara).
3.	 Finally, construction of a bridge in Payang village 
(West Kutai).
Notwithstanding its reasonably significant contributions 
to the state, in executing its operations, ITM did not 
receive any financial aid from the government. 
CONTRIBUTIONS TO REGIONAL ECONOMIC 
GROWTH
Opening up an area for mining will automatically cause 
the regional economy to grow.  Operational activities 
contribute indirectly in the form of absorbing local 
labor in the operational area.  The employment of 
local people is both directly by ITM, as well as by ITM’s 
business partners, who are our suppliers and mining 
partners.  With the increased level of local employment, 
the quality of life of the local community is also 
increased.  
In addition to the direct and indirect impact on the 
local economy resulting from operations, we also 
contribute through the payment of motor vehicle taxes 
on our fleet of operational vehicles for the region.  This 
means the Company is contributing directly to directly 
generated regional income (PAD).
RELATIONSHIP WITH SUPPLIERS
The Company realizes the importance of the existence 
of parties that act as suppliers to operational 
sustainability.  Positive interaction between the 
Company and its suppliers has a positive effect on the 
company’s performance.  Therefore, our work partners/
suppliers are part of the chain of business operations.  
For suppliers to satisfy the need for goods/services, 
ITM applies a basic principle for procurement that is 
efficient, effective, open and competitive, transparent, 
non-discriminative and accountable.  This is to achieve 
targets determined according to defined times that can 
be accounted for. 
There are approximately 12 mining contractors, both 
large and small, interacting with ITM’s operations at 
this time. We apply the principle of professionalism 
in our working relationships with all these mining 
contractors. The performance of mining contractors 
at ITM mine sites is monitored using CMS (Contractor 
Management System). CMS is a performance-focused 
system implemented in all ITM mine locations with the 
purpose of managing mine contractors consistently 
and comprehensively.  CMS assists with achieving the 
Company’s business goals in a commercial, technical, 
quality and environmental, as well as occupational 
health and safety aspect. 
The main purpose of CMS is to improve the 
management practices of the ITM mine contractors 
with the aim of optimizing results for the Company, 
as well as the contractors.  This, of course, starts with 
good mine budgeting and planning, the study of risks 
and mitigating factors, clear scope of work and a tight 
mechanism to select contractors.  This is followed by 
continual monitoring and support for the contractors 
throughout the contract period, until the end of their 
respective contracts.  
As part of its efforts to empower the local economies, 
the Company provides the opportunity to local small 
businesses and cooperatives, including competent 
fostered partners, to work in certain service sectors.  
Several non-operational jobs are handled by local 
suppliers, for example, catering, supplying seedlings for 
regreening and bokashi fertilizer supply. Overall, the 
value of the work contracts amounts to Rp100 million 
and is prioritized for local partners in the Company’s 
main operational area.

Preserving The Environment 
For Sustainability
Extreme weather triggers a variety of natural disasters 
such as floods, landslides, hot air temperatures that 
spark widespread forest fires in various hemispheres, 
as well as other forms of disasters. This fact has 
begun to highlight the serious problems facing the 
environment. Naturally, if there is subsequent climate 
change as a cause of extreme weather, this becomes an 
environmental issue that demands world attention. 
Various discussions have been undertaken to look 
for the best ways to mitigate climate change. These 
discussions have led to a common awareness that 
human activity, which is a primary source of climate 
change, should be carried out in accordance with 
environmentally-friendly principles, especially in 
relation to energy use. This collective awareness 
among the global community may then be realised in 
a number of mitigation activities that in essence form 
efforts to preserve environmental conditions as part 
of sustaining the earth as well as all the forms of life 
dependent upon it.
With increasing awareness among the world 
community of the dangers of climate change, every 
activity that is considered to have a significant impact 
upon the continuity of the environment attracts greater 
attention, particularly from concerned parties. Attention 
is directed towards efforts to minimise the impact of 
these activities upon the surrounding environment.         
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF MINING
Open coal-mining operations involve a process of 
changing the landscape. Coal mining operations 
that employ an open-pit method are preceeded by 
clearing the land, then stripping the soil cover to mine 
the seams of coal beneath the layer of overburden. 
Thereafter, the coal is shipped using transportation on 
land, river or sea to reach the end users, the majority of 
which are steam power plants.  
During the land-clearing stage, the entire population in 
the area who run farms, cultivate fields and plantations 
or other traditional livelihood activities, must be moved 
(relocated). Various crops and shrubs must also be 
removed or replanted in other areas.
The whole chain of coal mining activities are perceived 
to contribute toward global warming which lead to 
increased frequency of weather anomaly such as 
extreme weather event.
As one of the coal mining companies in Indonesia 
affiliated with a holding company that also undertakes 
activities relating to the supply of energy resources in 
several countries, PT Indo Tambangraya Megah Tbk 
(ITM) always runs operations that are environmentally-
friendly. We are committed to making ITM a mining 
company that has a genuinely positive impact upon 
environmental conservation efforts by running a 
number of programs on environmental management 
and conducting mining operations that have a minimal 
impact upon the environment.   
Therefore, every step of our field operations is 
carried out with due attention to the items contained 
within the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), 
Environmental Management Program (UKL) and 
Environmental Monitoring Plan (UPL), which are 
drawn up in accordance with the mandate laid out 
in Environment Law No. 32/2009 on Environmental 
Protection and Management. We also present 
the operational steps that are pursuant to these 
regulations to all stakeholders. The entire process 
of planning, mining, closure and rehabilitation, 
following the accompanying impact, goes into these 
documents, which then become a reference for our 
operational activities.  
COMMITMENT, POLICY AND OBJECTIVES
ITM commitment toward protection of the environment 
is contained in Environmental Policy, which stated that: 
“In performing operational activities, ITM will work 
based on following principle:
•	
Prevent, minimize, and manage its environmental 
impact.
•	
Follow the relevant environmental regulations. 
•	
Pursue conservation of the environment through 
sustainable policies”.
25
2013 Sustainability Report
As a form of our commitment to conserving the 
environment, we have implemented a series of 
programs with respect to our basic policy, including:
•	
The implementation of energy-saving operations.
•	
The restoration of biodiversity through 
revegetation.
•	
The preparation of independent mine closure 
communities.
ACCREDITED ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT 
STANDARDS
As proof of our commitment to conducting quality 
environmental management, we run an accredited 
Environmental Management System ISO 14001:2004. 
Its aim is to improve the effectiveness of environmental 
management activities, which include environmental 
management systems, environmental auditing, 
environmental performance evaluations and principal 
life-cycle assessments.
We also implement other accredited management 
systems in our operational activities, comprising 
Quality Management System (QMS) ISO 9001:2008 
and Occupational Hazard and Health Management 
System (K3) OHSAS 18001:2007. Up to the end of 2013, 
the company has accomplished several management 
system certifications, such as: 
PT Indominco Mandiri: 
•	
ISO 9001:2008 for Bontang Coal Mining Operation, 
certified since 29th October 2003.
•	
OHSAS 18001:2007 for Bontang Coal Mining 
Operation, certified since 19th October 2004.
•	
ISO 14001:2004 for Bontang Coal Mining Operation, 
certified since 8th November 2004. 
PT. Kitadin (Tandung Mayang): 
•	
ISO 9001:2008 for Mining Contractor, certified since 
2nd December 2005.
•	
OHSAS 18001:2007 for Provision of Coal Mining 
Operation, certified since 8th January 2013.
•	
ISO 14001:2004 for Provision of Coal Mining 
Operation, certified since 8th January 2013. 
PT. Jorong Barutama Greston has received ISO 
9001:2008 certification for Coal Mining Operation, 
certified since 20th February 2008.  
PT. Trubaindo Coal Mining has received ISO 9001:2008 
certification for Coal Mining Operation, certified since 
18th July 2003.
In accordance with the certified environmental 
management system, we design and carry out 
a number of environmental programs that are 
generally divided into two main areas, Environmental 
Management and Environmental Monitoring. 
We measure the success of each program via its 
compliance with a series of parameters contained in 
Environmental Quality Standards (EQS) in accordance 
with applicable local and central government 
regulations or accreditation standards. The measuring 
of these parameters is carried out by independent, 
competent parties.  
ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANISATION STRUCTURE
We have established a Department for Quality, 
Safety and Environment (QSE) as an internal body, 
which is structurally responsible for coordination 
and monitoring compliance with safety, health and 
environmental standards. In carrying out operational 
activities, each business unit formulates and 
implements work programs in the environmental field 
that are appropriate to the real conditions encountered 
on the ground. Nevertheless, all these work units need 
to constantly coordinate and discuss the programs 
they intend to run with the QSE Department. The 
QSE Department then assesses compliance against 
the applicable regulations. In order to ensure that the 
formulation and implementation of each program is 
carried out both effectively and efficiently, the QSE 
Department places a representative in each work unit.

ENVIRONMENTAL FIELD TRAINING
To improve knowledge and skills throughout 
the entire range of operations in the field of 
environmental management, we have developed an 
environmental training program that is carried out 
both in-house as well as by sending employees to 
attend external training.
The topic conducted on in house training included: 
Mine Rehabilitation and Basic Acid Mine Drainage 
(AMD) with 32 participants in 2013. Meanwhile, 
we sent 15 employees to attend training on the 
following issues: Discussion of regulations and 
preparation of a technical draft for the rehabilitation 
of watersheds, Mine closure planning, Management 
and supervision of acid mine drainage, Energy 
audits and the formulation of energy-saving 
programs, Implementation and reporting of the 
EIA and UKL-UPL, Mine closures, Technical briefing 
on the application, monitoring and evaluation of 
forest reclamation, Mode sampling training on 
the environment and waste water, Management 
of hazardous and toxic waste products and mine 
drainage systems.
SUPPLYING AND MONITORING LAND 
In order to fulfil our land-supply program, we always 
base the process on the clarity of identification 
documents, followed by an area evaluation according 
to the plan map for ​
mining operations. If an area is not 
yet in our region of control, we carry out a process of 
land acquisition in accordance with applicable laws and 
regulations, including provisions listed in the Mining 
Permit (IUP) for the region.
We carry out land acquisition by applying the 
principle of a consensus agreement in accordance 
with standard operating procedures (SOPs) governing 
the acquisition of land. Our goal is to obtain a value 
for profit agreement that is acceptable to both sides. 
Paying compensation for land and lost crops belonging 
to local communities is carried out by involving local 
officials at the hamlet, village and subdistrict levels. 
We also involve local village heads in the process. This 
is done so as to avoid future land conflicts with local 
communities. All the stages that we go through are 
recorded in extensive documentation. By employing 
a mechanism that can be received and documented, 
there is no danger of land disputes being triggered 
with local populations relating to land acquisitions. 
If during the land acquisition process, it is necessary 
to resettle or relocate an entire population to another 
region, we always ensure that the process is conducted 
well and that we have paid thorough attention to 
the rights of the local residents as well as, of course, 
thoroughly preparing the relocation area. Meeting the 
provisions on the sterilization of managed areas from a 
residential area located near a mining site is our main 
concern when carrying out relocations.
28
Preserving The Environment 
For Sustainability
In the past few years, we have conducted relocations in mining areas, which came under the management PT PETI. 
Realization of Land Clearing and Reclamation
Land clearing plan was realized in 2013 on 1.555,88 Ha of mining concession area of ITM subsidiaries (PT. Indominco 
Mandiri, PT. Trubaindo Coal Mining, PT. Jorong Barutama Greston, PT. Bharinto Ekatama, PT. Kitadin Tandung Mayang, 
and PT. Kitadin Embalut). The land clearing process was done in several stages which are the stripping of topsoil layer, 
the stripping of overburden, and followed by the excavation of coal material. The topsoil stripped would be piled on 
selected areas or disseminated on areas which are ready for the planting process. In the area where mining operation 
has been finished, we closed the quarry pit by piling overburden using backfilling method, adding pile of ground 
cover, and subsequently carry out the process of rehabilitation and revegetation. In 2013, 903,29 Ha area has been 
revegetated where 465.521 plants was planted and the growth percentage of native plants reached 79%.

Preparing reasonable environmental management 
funds through to the cessation of mining activities 
in the form of a Reclamation Guarantee and 
Environmental Provisions. 
All environmental management programs are run, 
monitored and evaluated on a regular basis in line with 
the ISO 14001:2004 accreditation system. This is part of 
our ongoing efforts to improve, with the ultimate aim 
of controlling and minimising environmental impact 
from our mining operations. 
Each year, we determine environmental target 
indicators, based on applicable regulations, to measure 
the effectiveness of our environmental management. 
These indicators refer to provisions at local government 
level as well as the Environment Ministry, and other 
relevant regulations. 
In order to fulfil the provisions on maintaining 
the quality of the environment in accordance 
with environmental quality standards (EQS), we 
run environmental management programs that 
cover modified land areas, land clearing and 
reclamation of mined land, crop care, draining slurry 
into sedimentation basins, the making of slurry 
sedimentation basins, seeding and planting, top soil 
management, preventing acid mine drainage (AMD), 
erosion control, research and development, handling 
Hazardous and Toxic Waste Materials, emissions and 
effulents, and implementing community development 
programs (CDC/CS).
We use the standard parameters as laid out in 
regulation of Ministry of Environment No. 21/2008 on 
Stationary Source Emission Standards and Environment 
Ministry Regulation No. 05/2006 on a Motor Vehicle 
Exhaust Emissions Threshold when monitoring 
environmental quality. We have succeeded in managing 
our operations well, keeping the EQS parameters to 
below those in the applicable provisions, with the result 
that during the reporting period, no monetary fines 
were imposed on ITM due to environmental violations. 
Use of Materials 
Our coal mining operations do not involve processing, 
so no raw materials are needed. The work we 
undertake is to remove the total volume of overburden, 
extract the coal seams that are then broken down 
according to the size required, and then transport them 
to consumers.
 
To carry out these activities, we need several 
operational support materials, including explosives (to 
break through hard layers of overburden), fuel, grease 
and lubricants for operational vehicles as well as lime 
(to neutralize acid mine drainage). All of these materials 
are non-renewable. Details of the use of each of these 
support materials is as follows.

Recycled Materials and Reused Materials
In addition to the materials mentioned above, we also 
use recycled and reused materials for different kinds of 
activities, which include:
•	
Recycled plastic to hold household/office rubbish, 
while used paper is utilised for wrapping/packing 
spare parts for support activities.
•	
Used oil is employed in mixing ammonium nitrate 
fuel oil (ANFO), which is utilised during the blasting 
process.
•	
Reconditioned conveyors for conveyor belts, and
•	
Reconditioned bearings for bearing replacement.
Energy Management and Use 
We use energy sources for two purposes, namely 
operations and operational support. For operations, we 
use two sources of energy in our supply chain: primary 
energy in the form of fuel oil (BBM) and coal, and 
secondary energy in the form of electric power, which is 
supplied by PT PLN as well as self-owned power plants. 
Primary energy in the form of fuel and diesel is used 
for mining and transportation, while coal is used for 
the private electric power plants. Our electrical power is 
used to support our mining operations, administrative 
needs and lighting.
 
The amount of primary energy used for mining 
activities and transportation correlates positively with 
the intensity of the activities in those two areas. As 
illustrated in the following table, any decline in mining 
activities is accompanied by a similar reduction in 
energy consumtion. While the work at harbours of 
loading and unloading for trade purposes continues to 
rise, in line with the increased loading and unloading 
of coal in stockpiles, part of which emanates from coal 
purchases.

ITM implement energy concentration through austerity 
measures and efficiency improvement of production 
processes.
In order to reduce the consumption of electricity, both 
the electricity generated at self-owned power plants 
and that supplied by PLN, ITM has applied a series 
of energy-saving policies. The programs and policies 
adopted to save electricity include: 
1.	 Raising awareness among and encouraging our 
employees to:
•	
Raise AC temperature settings.
•	
Maximise AC capacity, and 
•	
Use natural light whenever possible.
2.	 Using capacitor banks.
3.	 Using energy-saving lightbulbs.
4.	 Using spotlights with LED lightbulbs.
5.	 Using solar cell lights in areas that are not 
connected to electricity grids.
6.	 Improving the quality of the electricity network.
7.	 Maintaining roof casing conveyors. 
While to reduce the consumption of BBM, several 
initiatives have been launched, which include: 
1.	 A mining operations optimisation program. 
2.	 Load tests on every piece of heavy eqipment.
3.	 Setting the filling distribution of BBM for heavy 
equipment.
4.	 Monitoring and regulating servicing for non-mining 
vehicles.

ITM implement consistent effort and study so that the 
overall energy usage data indicate a decrease in energy 
requirements.
Water Conservation 
We do not use water for any processing activities but 
rather for several other purposes such as “washing” the 
coal (using a spraying method) in order to clean off 
the slurry attached to it, spraying transportation areas 
and crushing to reduce dust, cooling and raw materials 
at coal-fired power plants as well as for necessary 
bathing, washing and toilet (MCK) facilities, both in the 
field and in our offices. 
The results that we have compiled show our mining 
efficiency measures have also had an impact on our use 
of water. The estimated volume of water used for coal 
production in 2012 amounted to 0.8 m3/ton. In keeping 
with a reduction in coal production, the amount of 
water used for coal production in 2013 also went down, 
to around 0.3 m3/ton. The source of the majority of the 
water used was surface water/ river water.

Besides surface water as mentioned above, ITM 
via its subsidiary, PT IMM, also utilises sea water 
from adjacent areas. The total amount of sea water 
used throughout 2012 and 2013 is illustrated in the 
following table.

We seek to minimise the use of water by applying an 
efficiency policy, which includes imposing a limit on the 
amount of water used for MCK facilities, conserving 
water for washing operational vehicles and so on. In 
addition to these efficiency measures, we make other 
efforts to improve the quality of water around our 
operational areas. 
One of these efforts to improve water quality is to 
actively treat acid mine drainage (AMD) in a Slurry 
Sedimentation Basin with the addition of lime, which 
results in water quality meeting EQS before being 
discharged into surface/seawater. The results of a 
test examining the quality of waste water, which 
was conducted by a third party, showed that all the 
parameters measured were in accordance with EQS 
provisions.

Preserving The Environment 
For Sustainability
To maintain the availability of surface water and to nurture the conservation of the environment, especially water 
sources, we also conserve water resources in several ways, including: 
1.	 Using mine water to sprinkle on the roads and production facilities.
2.	 Using rain water to wash heavy machinery.
3.	 Creating ponds to conserve water; as well as
4.	 Making absorption pits in our office complexes and settlements.
All the water used in operational activities is eventually collected, thus forming a closed-loop water consumption 
system so as not to disrupt the availability of surface water. By utilizing this method, water that has already been 
used and recycled will be returned to public waterways in a good condition that is fit for use.  
Via these measures, we actively participate in efforts to maintain and preserve surface water sources. The impact 
has been positive and during the reporting period, ITM received no reports or complaints concerning any 
disruption to water sources due to a lowering of water levels as a result of water extraction. 
ITM regularly monitors the effect of the water returned to public waterways upon local biodiversity. Our results 
indicate that the water discharged has had no negative impact upon biodiversity. The results from monitoring 
Aquatic Biota showed that the waterways in areas surrounding ITM’s operations had suffered no significant 
disturbance, as indicated by the value of the diversity index, which was at a fairly good level.  
Controlling Emissions 
As a form of our participation in efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, we have implemented 
a program to control emissions in a structured and planned way. The main source of emissions from ITM’s 
operational activities is the use of mining equipment that employs non-renewable fossil fuels, namely diesel fuel 
and gasoline along with the installation of coal-fired power plants. ITM’s total GHG emissions are almost always 
directly proportional with the intensity of our coal production operations. 
Based on the amount of fuel oil usage and the level of burning effectiveness of the means of production and our 
own operational tools, the estimated CO2 emissions in 2013 from the company’s mining activities were as follows.

 1,177,214.23 
In order to mitigate the sources of emissions, we regularly carry out emissions tests on production facilities and 
transportation support vehicles both in the field and at our headquarter/branch offices. The moving object 
emissions test is carried out in accordance with Ministry of Environment Regulation No. 05/2006, while stationary 
objects are tested in accordance with Ministry of Environment Regulation No. 21/2008. 
Tests are conducted by third parties in cooperation with authorised agencies to ensure that all ITM’s primary and 
operational support equipment emits the lowest possible emissions, pursuant to the applicable regulations. These 
measurements, which are taken on a routine basis, are set against emission standards for moving equipment 
(operational vehicles) and stationary equipment (incinerators and generators).

The parameters measured include, among other things, sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and 
particulates, bearing in mind that direct and indirect emissions have the potential to cause health problems to both 
people and animals. The results of the measurements taken so far show that all the parameters are consistently 
below the specified EQS levels. The results of air quality measurements based on exhaust emissions throughout all 
installations at each mine location are as follows.

We also strive to reduce emissions of ozone-depleting substances by replacing the use of ozone-depleting 
chemicals, namely by gradually retrofitting refrigerant freon (CFC) with hydrocarbon, which is more environmentally 
friendly.  
The range of activities that we undertake to mitigate GHG includes:
1.	 Combatting fugitive emissions:
•	
Monitoring stationary and mobile emission sources.
•	
Burning garbage in closed areas.
37
2013 Sustainability Report
2.	 Implementing programs to reduce GHG, such as:
•	
Revegetation program using trees that are 
known to reduce air pollution and absorb CO2 
(Angsana, Trembesi, Tanjung and Mahogony).
•	
Open land to a minimum.
•	
Defend native vegetation.
3.	 Replace ozone-depleting chemical substances, 
namely CFCs, with domestic hydrocarbon products.
Transportation Impact
Besides gas emissions, we are also concerned with 
efforts to reduce dust as a result of transporting coal, 
especially in residential areas near our operations. 
We routinely monitor levels of dust particles in the air 
around our mining areas. The efforts we undertake to 
reduce dust pollution include:
1.	 Watering/spraying the front of a mine when 
excavating and loading coal.
2.	 Regularly watering the production roads.
3.	 Carrying out revegetation and creating buffer 
zones.
4.	 Implementing a dust suppression system at 
stockpiles on a regular basis.
5.	 Imposing restrictions on truck loads and speeds.
6.	 Undertaking routine care/maintenance of heavy 
equipment to reduce gas pollutants; and
7.	 Planting trees alongside transport roads (green 
barriers).
Waste Management and Treatment 
ITM applies the 3R policy in managing and processing 
waste, which comprises: 
1.	 Reduce: attempting to reduce the amount of waste 
through operating efficiently.
2.	 Reuse, attempting to reuse items that have already 
been used; and
3.	 Recycle, attempting to recycle things ourselves, 
wherever possible, or hand things over to a 
competent authority for recycling.
Our mining activities produce operational waste 
from our support facilities and infrastructure around 
our mines as well as from activities undertaken by 
communities and employees in the area of our mine 
sites. The different kinds of waste consist of solid waste, 
liquid waste and hazardous and toxic waste. The origins 
of these waste products and the way we manage them 
is outlined below:
  
1.	 Solid waste
•	
Items that still have some economic value are 
sold, while those that have no economic value 
are dumped in landfills.
•	
Waste products such as old/second-hand and 
scrap metal, second-hand conveyor belts, old 
batteries, second-hand tyres and fly ash.
•	
Items we continue to use as backups after being 
reconditioned. This is part of our reuse policy. 
Items that we reuse include second-hand spare 
parts, second-hand conveyors and so on. 
•	
Solid waste in the form of fly ash originates from 
the coal-fired power plant in the area operated 
by PT Indominco Mandiri. We plan to use the fly 
ash to manufacture paving blocks.

2.	 Liquid waste
•	
One form of liquid waste is used lubricating oil 
or oil that is spilled during oil changes. 
•	
To prevent any oil that is spilled from becoming 
contaminated, we fit oil traps on our workshop 
floors.
•	
We utilise part of the used oil to mix ANFO 
explosives. We hand the remainder over to 
collectors.
•	
The total amount of our used oil and how it is 
utilised is described in the following table.

3.	 Hazardous and Toxic waste
•	
Examples of hazardous and toxic substances 
are used oil/lubricants, used batteries, used 
oil filters, contaminated dust cloths/sawdust, 
fluorescent lights and incinerator residue. All 
these waste substances are stored in temporary 
storage areas specifically for hazardous and 
toxic materials.  
•	
Handling:
•	
Used oil/lubricants, used batteries, 
fluorescent lights, grease, incinerator 
residue, fixers and developers and 
cartridges/toners are taken and transported 
by collection and processing companies, 
which specialise in hazardous and toxic 
materials and are authorised by the 
Environment Ministry, in accordance with the 
provisions in Government Regulations No. 
18 and No. 85/1999 on the Management of 
Hazardous and Toxic Waste.    
•	
Used filters and contaminated dust cloths/
sawdust are burned in an incinerator. We 
carry out a bio-remediation process on 
material tainted with hydrocarbon.
•	
We continually submit balance sheets on 
hazardous and toxic waste to the relevant 
institutions.
•	
We never export or import hazardous and toxic 
waste substances that are listed in the Basel 
Convention Annex I, II, III and VII. None of the 
company’s waste products are included in those 
categories of the convention.  
4.	 General waste
•	
This originates from ITM’s residential and mining 
areas.
•	
We dispose of domestic waste in landfills. The 
management of organic waste involves local 
communities who turn it into bokashi fertilizer, 
which we then buy and use on our revegetated 
land. 
•	
Other materials that are not directly associated 
with aspects of our production are treated as 
follows: using paper efficiently (for example, 
using paper back-and-forth or reusing it), 
used printer ink cartridges are returned to the 
manufacturer and plastic is used to its optimum 
effect. The domestic waste produced is handled 
by relevant departments. All such waste is 
recycled by competent third parties. 
Managing AMD (Acid Mine Drainage)
Alongside our operational activities, in the process 
of excavation, soil removal and the extraction of 
coal seams, pools of water always emerge in the pit, 
whether from rainwater runoff or an accumulation of 
surface water. This accumulated water, which always 
accompanies open-mine practices, is usually acidic and 
is known by the term, acid mine drainage (AMD). 
Materials that has potential to generate a form of  acid 
reaction (Potential Acid Forming-PAF) will receive a 
special handling at the material placement (overburden), 
in order to keep the reaction and to produce acid to 
water, both at the surface water and ground water. Any 
materials that have potentially acid forming reaction is 
encapsulated and placed on the bottom surface,  which 
the coating material is non-acid forming (NAF) and it is 
topped with a compacted top soil layer with 1-2 meters 
thick.
ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND 
DEVELOPMENT
We carry out a number of studies and research that 
contribute to the process of evaluating environmental 
conditions in our mining areas and their environs. 
Several environmental research and development 
studies that we conducted in 2013 included:

ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING
We routinely monitor environmental conditions in our 
mining areas to minimise environmental degradation, 
and also as part of our efforts to mitigate risks to the 
environment. This environmental monitoring includes: 
monitoring water quality, air quality, soil quality, soil 
contamination, erosion, and monitoring wildlife and 
aquatic biota living around our mining areas.  
In 2013, we carried out a number of routine monitoring 
activities, which are described in the following table.

Monitoring is performed using survey, meeting, and 
training for local communities (head of the village, 
traditional leaders, and land acquisition team)
This routine monitoring offers an overview of the degree to which EQS provisions were met, while the development 
of environmental quality in managed areas as well as around them included:  
•	
the monitoring of aquatic biota (plankton, benthos and nekton) in bodies of water near harbours and areas of 
surface water by third parties showed improved water quality that could support living aquatic biota.
•	
Wildlife monitoring showed that locations that had been rehabilitated and revegetated were able to support 
wildlife.
•	
the monitoring of revegetation showed that overall, planting activities were running well, with a revegetated 
plant-growth success rate of more than 80%. Meanwhile, maintenance activities needed to be improved.
•	
Economic, social and cultural (ECOSOC) monitoring showed that overall, the implementation of environmental 
management and environmental monitoring complied with the environmental management and monitoring 
plan as laid out in the EIA.
Managing Biodiversity
ITM looks at the conservation of biodiversity as part of its efforts to maintain the earth’s sustainability. Therefore, 
all of our 6 operational areas, which are located in protected forest and production forest areas, have Borrow 
and Use of Production Forest Areas permits, which are issued by the Forestry Ministry. The entire area within the 
scope of the Mining Permit (IUP) owned by ITM is managed without the involvement or presence of management 
agreements that involve indigenous people.

Preserving The Environment 
For Sustainability
In line with our holding policy, we apply a concept 
of environmentally-sound mining in carrying out our 
mining activities in our IUP areas. We implement this 
concept so as to restore the habitat in formerly mined 
areas to its original state. We strive to minimise the 
incidence of extreme changes to the landscape, which 
could result in a loss of vegetation on the land and its 
accompanying ecosystem.   
The various activities that we undertake to maintain 
biodiversity in our managed areas include: 
•	
Maximising revegetation using local plants.
•	
Carrying out a plant enrichment program with rare 
plants that are also economically valuable.
•	
cultivating plants in our own managed nursery, 
such as the Meranti (Shorea spp.), Black Orchid 
(Coelogyne pandurata) and so on.
To support the success of this program, we collect data 
on various habitats in our managed areas, mapping 
biodiversity while at the same time identifying the 
presence of protected flora and fauna species. The 
results of our mapping are used to support reclamation 
and rehabilitation in mine closure areas in order to 
restore the entire habitat and ecosystem. 
For protected animal, we monitor wildlife on a regular 
basis on former mine land that has been reclaimed. 
We apply a benchmark of conservation success by 
proving there has been an increase in the amount of 
wildlife (wild fowl, reptiles and mammals) compared 
to the period before we conducted our environmental 
management program. 
With respect to the possibility of protected flora 
and fauna in our managed areas, according to the 
provisions laid out by the International Union for 
Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources 
(IUCN) as well as the list of rare species issued by 
the Indonesian government, we routinely monitor 
for these forms of plantlife assisted by competent 
third parties. We conduct ongoing observations of 
the types of plantlife in accordance with these lists in 
ITM’s mining areas.  
During 2013, we identified diversity among local 
plant species and found several species that were 
listed on the IUCN’s Red List, such as Mangifera 
rubropetala (forest mango), which is categorised as 
extinct in the wild (EW), Dipterocarpus kunstleri and 
Hopea ferrugina, which are categorised as critically 
endangered (CE).

2013 Sustainability Report
We also rediscovered the Dendrobium spathipetalum orchid, which had not been seen for more than 90 years, 
either in a number of specific studies on orchids or by orchid lovers in general. In order to prevent the extinction 
of this species, we have developed a rescue and breeding cultivation plan that is supported by by the Purwodadi 
Botanical Garden and the Indonesian Institute of Sciences (LIPI). We also confirm that we will return every variety of 
local plant identified as part of our mine closure land reclamation and revegetation program.

The results of this rescue program show that 550 plant species making up a total of 1,404 varieties were 
successfully acclimatised in the nursery run by PT Indominco Mandiri. Later, we separated them, cultivated them 
and replanted them in reclaimed and rehabilitated land. 
Our various efforts are proof of our commitment to applying an environmentally-sound mining concept by mining 
efficiently, minimising environmental degradation and carrying out efforts to conserve the environment, including 
closing mine sites in a responsible way. 
Environmental Grievance Mechanism
Data on complaints from communities is strongly related to levels of compliance. ITM has a commitment to always 
fulfil existing regulations, including those regulations on the level of compliance of waste water that directly affects 
local communities. Data on the degree of compliance in 2012 and 2013 is as follows.

MINE PLANNING AND MINE CLOSURE 
IMPLEMENTATION
In the process of land clearing and reclaiming mine 
areas, we have complied with all the provisions 
contained in Law No. 4/2009 , Ministerial Regulation 
No. 18/2008 issued by the Minister of Energy and 
Mineral Resources and Government Regulation 
No.78/2010 for reclamation and mine closure, which 
stipulate
1. 	 Have a license to operate.
2. 	 Land clearing is done in stages.
3. 	 Replanting using native and non-native plants.
4. 	 Implement Cover Crop planting.
5. 	 Provide reclamation and post-mining operation 
plan.
6. 	 Report the progress of reclamation regularly.
We have designed and implemented various land 
reclamation/rehabilitation programs for former mines 
where mining activities have ceased. We are fully 
committed to realising our program of revegetation in 
all managed areas, both fixed and temporary.

2013 Sustainability Report
Revegetation and Rehabilitation
We integrate all aspects of mining from planning to 
mine closure. Our land-clearance activities for mining 
are always followed by land replanting after the mining 
has ended. We carry out mine closure land restoration 
in stages, which include:  
1.	 Collecting data on existing biodiversity.
2.	 Separating top soil to certain areas.
3.	 Breeding plant species that are used to perform 
mine closure land reclamation; and
4.	 Restoring land by replanting mine closure land and 
plant conservation.
We conduct revegetation in stages within a framework 
of biodiversity management by means of:
1.	 Revegetating cover crops to reduce erosion.
2.	 Revegetating pioneer species to form canopies.
3.	 Revegetating rain forest species.
We also initiate a number of environmental 
conservation programs in areas around and outside 
mining zones, both independently as well as with 
third parties, including local communities. In order 
to support all the revegetation, rehabilitation and 
reclamation activities, we own and have developed 6 
(six) seeding farms with the capacity to produce up 
to 852,390 seedlings per year. However, to meet the 
need for plant seedlings, we guide and support local 
communities in plant breeding for revegetation, as part 
of the implementation of Community Development 
activities. Afterwards, we buy the seeds from farmers 
incorporated within a farmers’ partnership that 
provides the seeds. The average number of plant 
seedlings purchased in a year is 149,935.

PERFORMANCE ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT CONTRACTOR
As part of its active commitment to environmental conservation, ITM and its subsidiaries incorporate 
environmental assessment considerations in the selection of contractors (mining and transportation) by using 
a Contractor Management System (CMS) in the stages of prequalification and determining tenders. By using 
this assessment, we expect the business partners we work with to also have a high level of commitment to 
environmental conservation when carrying out their operations. 
MINE CLOSURE PLAN
We are committed to enhancing the quality of life among local communities when our mining activities in 
PT Jorong Barutama Greston, as a subsidiary of ITM, come to an end. In preparing a mine closure, we compile 
documents on a mine closure plan that consists of planning mine closure activities, including environmental 
management and community empowerment. In compiling the mine closure documentation, we work together 
with educational institutions such as Lambung Mangkurat University (UNLAM), and Bogor Agricultural Institute 
(IPB), as well as with provincial governments and communities living around the mine. We endeavour to design 
and put into practice development and community empowerment programs that will enable the growth of 
productive activities for communities to meet their own needs and to obtain sustainable economic benefits 
following the cessation of mining operations. These activities include the following development initiatives:  
1.	 The cultivation of Buras Super Chickens and Queen Ducks.  
2.	 Demonstration plots for Dragon Fruit orchards, and   
3.	 Demonstration plots for intercropped fruit orchards.
G4-
EN32

2013 Sustainability Report
These activities include the preparation of several other aspects, including:
1.	 The legality of the mine closure area.
2.	 The re-allocation of labour.
3.	 Environmental management and monitoring after the mine closure; and
4.	 Drawing up estimates of the mine closure costs.

Ensuring Occupational 
Health and Safety
With the majority of its operational activities taking place 
in open areas, ITM acknowledges that Occupational 
Health and Safety (OHS) is one of the major determining 
factors in the company’s operational success. Therefore, 
we are fully committed to continually improving 
the quality of OHS management in our day-to-day 
operations. To demonstrate our commitment to the 
implementation of safe mining activities, ITM has 
established an OHS policy, which asserts that. 
1.	 Zero accidents that result in the loss of working days.
2.	 Zero recurrence of accidents.
3.	 Zero breaches and compliance requirements of 
OHS minimum standard throughout the operational 
activities.
In order to improve OHS management and to ensure 
that all work procedures carried out prioritise the 
different aspects of OHS, ITM integrates the units and 
operational aspects of OHS management into an ITM-
OHS management system. In addition, ITM has used 
OHSAS 18001:2007 certification standards since 2004.  
Through to the end of 2013, two of our subsidiaries, 
PT Kitadin and PT Indominco, obtained accreditation 
certificates for these safety standards from third parties. 
Meanwhile, our other subsidiaries recorded meaningful 
progress in their efforts to secure the same accreditation. 
 
Given the fact that ITM’s field activities involve mining 
contractors, we run a contractory safety management 
system (CSMS), which is intended to improve the 
effectiveness of OHS management as well as improving 
ITM’s performance together with third-party contractors 
in applying the OHS Management System. 
OHS Implementation Management
The Quality, Safety and Environment (QSE) Department 
is a work unit within the organisation’s structure 
responsible for guaranteeing the implementation of 
OHS rules as well as managing all other aspects relating 
to OHS. To ensure the involvement of all employees 
in fulfilling the elements of OHS in all operational 
activities, ITM has formed – via the QSE Department – an 
Occupational Health and Safety Committee. 
The member of OHS Committee consists of 
representatives of employees in each unit.
The obligation of all parties (employees and the 
company) to uphold and comply with all OHS 
requirements are emphasised in articles contained in the 
Collective Labour Agreement (PKB), such as Article 12 (in 
the PT Kitadin PKB) and Articles 34-35 (in the 
PT Indominco PKB), which is a form of agreement 
between the company and its employees. 
Compliance with these OHS provisions asserts that all 
ITM employees, when performing their operational 
activities, must pay due attention to all aspects of OHS.

Ensuring Occupational 
Health and Safety
This is a very important point, bearing in mind that 
almost all operational activities are conducted outdoors, 
so those workers involved in such activities face a higher 
risk of having an accident. It is estimated that more than 
70% of ITM’s employees are involved in operational 
activities located outside. 
ITM routinely carries out OHS Committee meetings, 
both with relevant work units and with work/mining 
contractor partners. The aim is to remind all parties to 
continually adhere to all OHS provisions. At the OHS 
Committee level, meetings were conducted once every 
one month months with the number of meetings in 2013 
totalling 72 times. 
To anticipate and overcome the risk of work accidents 
and, further, to support business continuity, ITM has 
established an Emergency Response Team (ERT) at each 
of its subsidiaries. The ERTs are coordinated by the QSE 
Department. ITM already an Emergency Response Team 
at each site and actively participate in the Indonesian 
Fire and Rescue Challenge (IFRC), held by Ministry of 
Energy and Mineral Resources (Kementerian ESDM). 
These teams have been trained by the National Search 
and Rescue Agency (BASARNAS).
 
Realisation of the OHS Program in 2013
In 2013, in order to improve performance of OHS 
provisions in operational areas, ITM implemented a 
number of strategic steps relating to OHS, as described 
in the following list. 
•	
The revision and evaluation of OHS policies to 
strengthen ITM’s commitment to recording zero 
lost working days, zero recurrence of accidents and 
zero violations of legal obligations and compliance 
regarding the minimum OHS requirements at all 
operational areas.  
•	
The checking of all health facilities that can be used 
by all employees, including contractor employees, 
and also conducting annual health checks. 
•	
The regular evaluation of documentation 
concerning Hazard Identification, Risk Assessment 
and Risk Control at every work unit.
•	
The evaluation of the Contractor Management 
System related to fulfilling OHS aspects in mining 
operations. 
•	
The regular training of ERTs, engaging ITM’s 
Emergency Response Team (Indominco) at the 16th 
Indonesian Fire & Rescue Challenge (IFRC), a mining 
company team rescue competition that is held 
every year. 
•	
Standardisation training or HR certification on OHS. 
The aim is to motivate employees at all managerial 
levels to care about OHS and to encourage 
conscious behaviour regarding the different aspects 
of OHS. 
•	
In addition to this certification program, to improve 
HR competence in OHS, ITM also conducted an 
internal training on OHS, which was attended by 
employees from various lines of management.
•	
Inspection accompanied by improving the condition 
of OHS apparatus and other standard OHS 
equipment at all operational mine sites. 
OHS Performance Statistics 2013
In general, based on the incident severity rate (ISR) and 
incident frequency rate (IFR), safety performance in 2013 
fell from the year before, due to an 83% increase in the 
number of major accidents and a 33% increase in minor 
accidents compared to 2012. 
Compared with the previous year, reports of near 
misses went down, which was inversely proportional 
to the number of accidents (major and fatal), which 
rose. If viewed based on an Accident Pyramid Diagram 
(designed by Frank Bird), a decrease in near misses is 
followed by a decrease in accidents (major and fatal). 
However, looking at the incident reports for 2013, the 
decrease in near misses were not followed by a similar 
decrease in the number of accidents (major and fatal). 
This was due to a lack of reporting of near misses.

Occupational Health
In order to maintain and improve the health of its employees and their families, ITM conducts activities that are 
managed within two main groups, namely:
•	
Occupational health of a medical nature, and 
•	
Occupational health connected to a helthy work environment. 
The management of occupational health of a medical nature is coordinated by ITM, the activities of which include:
•	
employee health screening, including:
•	
Pre-employee medical check-up.
•	
Regular medical chec-up, which are routinely performed at least once a year. In 2013, all ITM employees 
underwent periodic health examinations.
•	
Spesific medical check-up.
•	
Employee health promotion, namely: offering education, training and counselling to prevent health disorders as 
well as work-related diseases, illnesses resulting from work relationships and general illnesses; and 
•	
Preventive health measures, such as fumigation, immunisation and so on.
The management of occupational health that relates to a healthy work environment is carried out by each work unit. 
The activities undertaken include: 
•	
Measuring work environment parameters.
•	
Monitoring sanitation in the cooking areas of all food and catering suppliers, and
•	
Promoting employee health. 
OHS Certification and Costs
To measure the effectiveness of the Occupational Health and Safety Management System, ITM carries out an internal 
audit up to 2 times per year  and an external audit 2 times per year. External audits are conducted by an Independent 
Certification Body, namely SGS and SAI Global. Based on its results for 2013, ITM (via PT Indominco Mandiri and 
PT Kitadin Tandung Mayang) was awarded OHSAS 18001:2007 Certification. 
During 2013, the total amount of funds allocated to cover the costs of various OHS-related items (training, equipment, 
health maintenance and certification) reached Rp73,947,137,167 billion.

Building Prosperous 
Communities
In line with ITM’s vision, that is to become a leading 
coal-based energy company in Indonesia with a 
continued growth achieved through professionalism 
and esteem for employees, communities, and the 
environment, we fully understand the importance of 
community development in all our operational areas. 
For ITM, the surrounding communities represent a 
stakeholder of the Company that also determines the 
sustainable business growth of the Company in the 
future, across all of its operational areas.
Through the design and implementation of our 
business development programs we therefore ensure 
that community-focused programs are in place, aimed 
at developing the livelihood of the communities. This 
is how ITM fulfills the expectations of the surrounding 
communities that are indeed one of ITM’s stakeholders.
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS’ GOALS
Mining activities generally take place in a relatively vast 
area of land, involving activities such as land clearing 
and mass transporting of the resources. These activities 
take place in locations that are in direct contact with 
the surrounding communities. As described earlier, 
ITM with its six subsidiaries (Indominco Mandiri, 
Kitadin Tandung Mayang, Kitadin Embalut, Trubaindo 
Coal Mining, Bharinto Ekatama, and Jorong Barutama 
Greston) operate in a large geographical area, spread 
into three locations, namely in East Kalimantan, Central 
Kalimantan, and West Kalimantan. ITM’s operational 
activities all coincide with the interest of the local 
communities.
We are fully committed in establishing rapport with 
the local communities that is always conducive and 
mutually beneficial in the long run. We place our 
emphasis on the communities living adjacent to our 
operational areas (Ring I), making them our priority. In 
these areas, interaction are more intense, and so we 
are able to recognize the needs of the people and may 
respond more readily by fulfilling their expectations 
accordingly.
In establishing and maintaining rapport with the 
surrounding communities, we have targeted for an 
increase in the wellbeing, self-sustaining capability, 
and competence of the communities in all walks of 
life. Enhanced competence in the public, especially in 
economy, social and general knowledge, will eventually 
bring self-sufficiency to the public, making them less 
reliant on us. Thus, if we must relocate our operations 
to other sites, which have more economically-promising 
coal resources, the surrounding communities whom we 
have left will be able to continue with their lives.
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT GOVERNANCE AND 
VALUES
ITM has implemented the values in the Banpu Spirit 
in developing and empowering the surrounding 
communities, among others through:

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT POLICY AND 
PROGRAMS 
We aim to apply a sustainability principle that 
embodies the Triple Bottom Line thinking (namely 
the balancing of the interests of the Planet, Profit, 
and People) in conducting our operational activities 
and in implementing our community development 
programs. This is to ensure that all programs are 
carried out as efficiently as possible. In carrying out 
our CD programs, we also take into consideration the 
provisions in the Company Law (Law No. 40) paragraph 
74. And to ensure the correct alignment of our 
community development programs with our long-term 
development goal, we pay close attention to the 
recommendations stipulated in the Environmental 
Impacts Analysis (AMDAL) documentation and the 
government-endorsed Millennium Development 
Goals (MDG). 
In addition, in the whole process of planning, 
implementation, and evaluation of our community 
development programs, we uphold good corporate 
governance principles. Our target, naturally, is to 
realize the Company’s vision in becoming a respectable 
corporate citizen.
To ensure the attainment of the abovementioned 
goals throughout all the stages of community 
development (namely planning, implementation, and 
evaluation), we involve the local communities and 
are respectful of the prevailing local wisdoms. All the 
activities within our programs have been planned 
and developed specifically for each location through 
a bottom up mechanism mentioned previously, that 
is the Community Consultative Committee (CCC). 
This mechanism encourages the involvement of the 
government and surrounding communities. This 
is in line with the Community Involvement aspect 
as stipulated in the ISO 26000 Guidelines, and also 
refers to the framework and parameters designated 
through research carried out by independent external 
consultants.
Members of the CCC may propose programs that 
they consider important for the communities, and the 
programs that are subsequently chosen will be included 
in the Company’s annual work plan and budget 
and reported to the Ministry of Energy and Mineral 
Resources.
Our community relations efforts are carried out 
intensively and simultaneously with the implementation 
of our community development programs, so 
that everyone involved will have the singularity of 
understanding in their support towards ensuring 
the success of ITM’s operational activities. We have 
developed our community development programs 
by categorizing them into the following four pillars of 
activities, as follows:
G4-
DMA
58
Building Prosperous 
Communities
1.	 Economic Development
Aimed at improving the welfare of communities by 
providing access to capital and skill development, 
and by supporting local economic activities using 
resources available locally.
2.	 Social Development
Aimed at improving the quality of life of 
communities by providing sufficient healthcare and 
educational facilities and also by encouraging the 
preservation of local culture.
3.	 Environmental Protection
Aimed at improving the communities’ awareness on 
the importance of preserving the natural state of 
their surroundings.
4.	 Community Relations
Aimed at ensuring that ITM shares the same 
perception with the communities and other relevant 
stakeholders.
 
The above four pillars have been further expanded into 
six major programs, each dealing with different areas, 
i.e. local economy, education, healthcare, environment, 
community relations, and infrastructure development. 
These six groups of programs reinforce one another 
and work as a unity towards implementing ITM’s 
corporate social responsibility in a sustainable manner.  
We have devised a program to supervise and monitor 
the progress of our community development programs, 
both quantitatively and qualitatively. Progress reports 
are submitted electronically to an online network 
called the Community Development Management 
Information System (CDMIS), which collects and tracks 
the latest developments and progress from each of 
our operational sites. Currently, this system has been 
implemented at PT Trubaindo Coal Mining and PT 
Jorong Barutama Greston. This system assists the CD 
officers in preparing their monthly activity reports.
The parameters used as our indicators of success 
include the following: output, beneficial effects, 
capacity building, quality of planning, quality of 
implementation, emergence of spontaneous new (in 
particular economic) activities, and level of public 
participation. Success indicators may vary, depending 
on the objectives of each program. These parameters 
are assessed by our Community Development officers, 
who are responsible for preparing an annual report 
of ITM’s Community Development initiatives and 
achievements, and are also reviewed by an external 
and independent consultant. With this, it is hoped that 
in the future the programs will be enhanced, a clear 
reflection of the PDCA (Plan–Do–Check–Action) system, 
which is espoused by ITM for its business development.
IMPLEMENTATION OF PROGRAMS
ITM through its subsidiaries own and operate 6 
operational areas that extend across 3 provinces, 4 
regencies and 1 town, 12 subdistricts, and 46 villages. 
Therefore ITM carries out community development 
activities In all these areas, with the intention of 
improving the quality of life of the surrounding 
communities. ITM prepares these communities to 
become self-sustaining socially and economically, 
and interacts on a daily basis with the locals and the 
relevant stakeholders on a continuous manner. 
The following section provides a brief description of 
several Community Development Programs that ITM 
carried out in 2013.
PT Indominco Mandiri
As coal production from PT Indominco Mandiri is the 
largest contributor to ITM’s current total coal output, 
the budget for PT Indominco Mandiri’s CD programs 
remains the biggest compared to that of other 
subsidiaries.
PT Indominco Mandiri operates in 3 regencies, 
with 4 subdistricts and 10 partnership villages. Total 
budget allocated for CD programs of PT Indominco 
Mandiri that was disbursed throughout 2013 was Rp12 
billion, covering three major aspects, namely local 
economic development, educational development, and 
community relations.
One of the programs of PT Indominco Mandiri 
continues to be the cultivation of golden melon, 
developed by a farmers’ collective in Bontang Lestari. 
The number of trees cultivated by the farmers in 
Nyerakat Kiri Village was up from 2,000 trees to 6,000 
trees, with production volume rising from 3 tons of 
golden melon to a staggering 11 tons. In addition, the 
number of watermelon trees cultivated by the farmers’ 
collective in Bontang Lestari rose from 4,000 trees to 
7,000, with yield up from 4 tons to 9 tons. In line with 
this, a considerable amount of work opportunities were 
created for the local people.
PT Indominco Mandiri developed snack products 
that are characteristic of its partnership villages. This 
effort was done in collaboration with Home Industry 
Indominco Mandiri (HITIM), and resulted in the 
G4-
EC7
G4-
DMA
59
2013 Sustainability Report
development of a number of promising potentials from the villages, namely instant ginger drink, borneo glass 
fish, amplang crackers, and banana crackers. As a result, the potential of the villages of Santan Ilir, Pulau Selangan, 
Kandolo, Suka Rahmat, Suka Damai, and Bontang Lestari have also been enhanced. Furthermore, through HITIM, 
ITM initiated the HITIM Mart, a minimarket for local products and daily grocery for families. As a testament to 
the program’s success, as many as 70 housewives now have products sold at this mart, helping to increase their 
household income.
The Community Learning Center (CLC) program of PT Indominco Mandiri, which initially was developed as 
Malahing CLC, was expanded into Damai Mandiri CLC established in Suka Damai. The program, which gained 
support from the Director General of PAUDNI at the Ministry of National Education of the Republic of Indonesia, 
has successfully improved the locals’ potentials in socioeconomic and cultural terms. This program marries formal 
education with creative activities, training, and understanding of local wisdoms, including women empowerment 
and entrepreneurship. In 2011, 42 people graduated from this program, whereas in 2012 there were 135 graduates, 
and in 2013 the figure rose to 187.
As proof of ITM’s concern for the protection of the environment, in 2013 PT Indominco Mandiri continued to plant 
mangrove seedlings along the coastline of Bontang Lestari, East Kalimantan. The activity was supported by all 
parts of the society, including students, young people, mothers, the Armed Forces, and the Police Force. The total 
number of trees planted throughout the period of 2009 to 2013 was 375,000.
Golden Melon Cultivation
The golden melon cultivation remains one of PT Indominco Mandiri’s top CD 
programs. First established as a pilot project in the Bontang Lestari Village 
involving the Kelompok Tani Sukses Bersama (KTSB) farmers’ collective, the 
golden melon plantation has been substantially expanded, with many other 
farmers’ groups in nearby villages following suit.
ITM supports the development of golden melon cultivation by providing the 
high-quality seeds, providing training, comparative studies, and guidance 
to the farmers’ collective. ITM even established the Bontang Melon Growers 
Association.
Mass harvesting of golden melons has now become a regular event. The 
availability of golden melons in the market all year long has successfully 
reduced the locals’ dependence on supply from Java.
Marketing of these golden melons has been increasingly expanded, and now 
the supply has been able to satisfy the demand from PT Indominco Mandiri, 
local fruit sellers, town markets, and business partners namely PT Anugerah 
Jasa Caterindo, Hotel Sintuk Bontang, and Ramayana Supermarket in Bontang 
Municipality. This program has shown its contribution to improving the 
wellbeing of the farmers’ collectives under PT Indominco Mandiri’s guidance, as 
well as other farmers, in the area.

Building Prosperous 
Communities
PT Jorong Barutama Greston
PT Jorong Barutama Greston is located in Tanah Laut 
Regency, South Kalimantan. This subsidiary will cease 
its operations in the near future, and as such, the 
single biggest challenge of its CD programs is to yield 
as substantial a long term impact as possible on the 
programs’ beneficiaries.
Through its CD programs, PT Jorong Barutama Greston 
strives to promote the characteristics of each of its 
partnership villages, an approach known as one village 
one product. Using its CD funding of Rp587 million 
for 2013, PT Jorong Barutama Greston has contributed 
significantly to the society in the mining circle 
through both short- and long-term programs, such as 
infrastructure development, scholarships, economic 
development, and sociocultural assistance.
The CD programs of PT Jorong Barutama Greston that 
are expected to bring a lasting impact on the society 
and also easy to implement are the cultivation of oyster 
mushroom, chicken coop, and bokashi organic fertilizer. 
The oyster mushroom cultivation, for which the market 
potential in Tanah Laut remains huge, has received the 
focus for development through ITM’s collaboration with 
Nurul Hijrah Islamic Boarding School in Alur Village. 
Initially this program was launched in the village of 
Jorong in 2012. In 2013, this program was implemented 
in three other villages, namely Alur, Asam-Asam and 
Karang Rejo. This program also provides training in 
collaboration with Lambung Mangkurat University 
(UNLAM). Participants are also taught to make various 
food products based on oyster mushroom, namely 
snacks, pudding, dumplings, and nuggets.
PT Kitadin
•	 Location Embalut
PT Kitadin Embalut is a site with a mining concession 
area of around 2,000 hectares, located in Kutai 
Kartanegara. Its production capacity in 2013 was 
1 million tons, and its budget for CD programs in 
2013 was Rp1 billion. As much as 37% of the budget 
was distributed for economic programs, where 
the CD team of PT Kitadin Embalut cooperated 
with the Office of Farming and Fishery to develop 
an integrated farming system and cow farming 
business.
Certain economic programs that have long-term 
impact and have been developed by PT Kitadin 
Embalut are cattle farming (for meat), chicken 
coop, fishery, and integrated farming. For its 
chicken coop program in 2013 PT Kitadin Embalut 
received the Gelar Karya Pemberdayaan Masyarakat 
(GKPM) Award from the Ministry of Public Welfare. 
Previously, in 2012, PT Kitadin Embalut also received 
similar award for its cattle farming program.
61
2013 Sustainability Report
In its fishery program, as many as 59 groups have been formed, 2 more from the previous year. The number 
of woven fish traps in 2013 reached 1,495 units. The chicken coop program has succeeded in increasing the 
number of chicken harvested by the four farmers’ collectives to 164 thousand chicken, up 2,000 chicken from 
the previous year. The net income of this chicken coop business for the year was estimated to be Rp534 million, 
or around Rp133.5 million per group.
• 	 Location Tandung Mayang
PT Kitadin Tandung Mayang is located in Kutai Timur and has a coverage area for community development 
that is similar to that of PT Indominco Mandiri, i.e. Teluk Pandan Village. For its long-term impact programs, 
PT Kitadin Tandung Mayang opted to develop duck farming business as it is in line with the need and custom 
of the local society. In addition, the supply of feedstuff for these ducks in Teluk Pandan Village is abundant. On 
average, each group collects a revenue of Rp6.9 million, translating into Rp600,000 per member.
PT Kitadin Tandung Mayang also provided training for machinery operators and mechanics. In 2013, two 
training sessions were held, involving a total of 36 participants, consisting of 22 operators and 14 mechanics.
PT Trubaindo Coal Mining
PT Trubaindo Coal Mining is located in Kutai Barat and is one of the largest sites of ITM. It covers 20 
partnership villages across three subdistricts. With a CD funding of Rp7.2 billion in 2013, PT Trubaindo Coal 
Mining conducted 120 community development programs encompassing five major areas, i.e. economy, social, 
Cattle Farming Initiative in Mine closure 
Areas
The cattle farming initiative in mine closure areas belonging to PT Kitadin 
Embalut has been carried out since 2002 by groups of farmers under the 
nurture of PT Kitadin Embalut. In the subsequent years, the number of farmers’ 
collectives grew and began to attract other farmers (those who are not under 
the nurture of the subsidiary) in 2009-2010.
The patterns that are developed through this initiative was one-roof cattle 
farming, group management, and time-alternating cattle foraging. Such a 
system allows for easy supervision and maintenance. Cattle supply subsequently 
increased and currently has been able to fulfill the vision of East Kalimantan 
Province of attaining self-sufficiency for meat.
Cow dung is also used as organic fertilizer that helps revitalize the condition of 
the mine closure areas, making the soil more fertile for other productive plants 
as well as for greenery.
These farmers’ collectives have obtained the support from the government (in 
this case the Office of the Indonesian Ministry of Agriculture and the Office of 
Farming of Kutai Kartanegara Regency), as well as training support from ITM.
This cattle farming initiatives brought two-pronged benefits, namely in 
increasing the income of the six farmers’ collectives involved in the initiatives, 
by 100% to as high as 400%, and in restoring soil fertility through the use of the 
organic fertilizer around the farming areas.

Building Prosperous 
Communities
infrastructure, health and education. For its infrastructure-related and community relations activities, in 2013 
PT Trubaindo Coal Mining disbursed 52% of its total CD budget, while allocation for its economic programs was 
around 25% of the total budget. 
Some of the long-term impact programs undertaken by the CD team of PT Trubaindo Coal Mining are watermelon 
cultivation and freshwater fishery in floating nets. Based on the evaluation of the CCC and the CD officer, it has 
been revealed that there is a huge demand for watermelon in Kutai Barat area. Currently, the type of watermelon 
that is cultivated is a local one with an average weight of 5-7 kg. There are 12 farmers divided into three groups 
that are taking part in the program. In developing this watermelon cultivation program, PT Trubaindo Coal Mining 
maintains a cooperation with the related governmental institution, Disbuntakan Kutai Barat, especially for the 
training and monitoring by the designated field officers.
The floating-net fishery is currently being developed in Empakuq Village, with about 17 personnel working in two 
different farmers’ collectives. An open market and a huge potential in fishing have made this program a highlight 
of PT Trubaindo Coal Mining’s Community Development initiatives.
PT Bharinto Ekatama
PT Bharinto Ekatama retains a mining concession in two regencies, namely Kutai Barat and Barito Utara, with a 
total of five partnership villages. Fund alocated for its CD programs in 2013 reached Rp1.35 billion. The largest 
proportion was allocated for education, totaling Rp578 million (44%).
Community education programs undertaken by PT Bharinto Ekatama covers scholarships for nurses, skillset 
training for young people, and scholarships and training opportunities for teachers. PT Bharinto Ekatama has also 
initiated a germplasm conservation program that involves local communities. As a result, at least 100 different 
orchid species have been collected and conserved by a number of groups in the partnership villages. In addition, 
PT Bharinto Ekatama is actively engaging contractors to participate in community development initiatives, among 
others in the catfish cultivation in Benangin Village, rubber cultivation training, and engine maintenance training.
Mining Closure Plan of PT Jorong Barutama Greston
As part of its mining closure plan, PT Jorong Barutama Greston has instigated and supported a number of mining 
closure preparation programs throughout 2013. The latest development of this plan has been the cooperation 
between it and UNLAM to disseminate a new community development and empowerment program, consisting of 
a number of initiatives, such as the execution of strategic efforts for one full year through the cultivation of specific 
types of poultry and local plantation, and also the restoration of habitat for rare plants. The memorandum of 
understanding for this program was signed by both parties on 23 November 2013.

Products and Services 
ITM’s main product is coal.  To maintain product quality in 
accordance with contractual clauses, ITM analyses the coal at 
every stage, from the beginning, at the start of exploration, 
through production, the handling process to pre-shipment.  
The analysis documents regarding the type and quality of 
the coal accompany the delivery process and are issued and 
verified by an accredited third party, until they reach the 
consumer.  
Handling coal requires a large area and heavy equipment 
for its transportation.  Therefore, ITM applies standard, 
accredited health and safety procedures to ensure the whole 
loading and transportation process does not cause any 
health issues for operators or the local communities.   
In line with general practices, we do not specifically package 
the coal.  The Company regulates the distance between the 
loading area and the closest residential area in accordance 
with health standards, while the size of the coal pieces is 
regulated in stages throughout the loading process to reduce 
the amount of fine dust during the transportation process.  
To reduce the impact of dust during transportation, at the 
stockpile area and along the transportation routes around the 
mine, water is sprayed regularly.  
Coal does not decompose easily (non-durable goods), thus 
an assessment of health impacts from handling coal has not 
been carried out based on the product’s life cycle, but for a 
specific period consistent with ISO standards provisions and 
OHS reference.
Compliance with operational standards, production 
procedures, transportation methods and delivery, with 
regular monitoring at every point the coal is moved, means 
that during the reporting period there have been no 
complaints from customers related to violations of rules or 
ethics on the health impacts of ITM’s products.  
Product Management and Quality Control 
ITM applies Coal Handling Procedures as a standard 
procedure to maintain product, involving recording coal 
quality, stockpiling, blending and loading.  The Company 
handles coal in accordance with ISO 9001:2008 Quality 
Management Standards to ensure the quality and supply of 
coal to the consumer.  Handling in accordance with standards 
means the following:
•	
Stockpile management 
Managing stockpiles of coal resulting from production 
and blending in accordance with quality classification, 
calories and consumer demand. 
•	
Quality control 
The company maintains the quality of its production 
through a tight quality control mechanism at each 
stage of production.  The quality control process is 
based on the ISO 9001:2008 Quality Management 
Standards.  With this system, ITM conducts sample 
tests to ensure the quality of the coal being mined in 
the mine stockpile area and at the port prior to loading 
onto the barge/ship.
•	
Loading
ITM cooperates intensively with shipping companies 
for the hauling process to transport the product from 
the mine to the jetty to be loaded onto the barges, or 
transported by land to the loading port.  This whole 
process chain is now supported by an information 
technology application, Supply Chain Management 
System (SCMS), designed and developed especially to 
support ITM’s operational activities.  
The Company has a quality control policy and 
complies with all relevant rules and legislation to 
satisfy customer demand.  All product dispatched 
always refers to the consumer’s demand specifications 
and blending is carried out, if necessary, to meet the 
requested quality specifications.  
The quality test results are always sent to the consumer.  
Through this transparent quality testing process, the 
consumer knows the product quality and quantity of coal it 
will receive from the mine to the loading port.  
CUSTOMER SERVICE 
ITM has developed a Customer Complaint Center to 
receive questions and complaints from the public and 
from customers.  This was done to reflect the Company’s 
realization of the importance and benefit of fulfilling 
quality standards and protecting customers for all products 
produced.  Both of these have a significant influence on the 
growth of sustainable business performance.  
The Company has made this complaint service available by 
phone, email and letter.  The Company always prioritizes 
the principles of transparency and responsibility in providing 
customer service, to meet its commitment to providing 
the best service to customers, providing a quick response 
to various customer requests and complaints as part 
of its service commitment, and maintaining customer 
confidentiality.  Therefore, during the reporting period, there 
have been no financial fines or other sanctions related to 
violations of customer confidentiality.  
ITM coordinates various efforts to ensure product quality 
to comply with consumer demand, in accordance with 
stipulations in purchase contracts and product specifications 
in marketing brochures and marketing presentation materials 
(marketing kit).

2013 Sustainability Report
To ensure the process runs as planned, the Company holds 
routine monthly meetings, namely planning coordination 
meetings.  Broadly speaking, the meetings discuss the supply 
chain performance, such as sales targets, production targets, 
transporting targets and quality targets.  
During the 2013 reporting year, the Company handled 3 
(three) complaints from customers related to quality not 
being as expected.  
ITM carried out an assessment and followed up the 
complaints and implemented corrective measures. The 
purpose is, to ensure that similar problems do not occur in 
the future. 
In order to maintain customer loyalty, the company 
implement a classification system based on the principle of 
the following criteria:
Platinum
1.	 ≥ 10 million Gross Profit USD/Year (Average 5 Years).
2.	 Continuous Buy during 2009-2013.
3.	 No Loss in any year during 2009-2013.
4.	≥ 10 USD/ton Gross Profit.
5.	 ≥ 500 k TOn/year (Average 5 Years).
6.	 Non - Trader (Power Operators).
Gold
1.	 ≥ 1 M Gross Profit USD/Yr (Average 5 Years).
2.	 Maximum loss for one year during 2009 - 2003.
3.	 ≥ 5 USD/Ton Gross Profit (@10% IRR before Tax).
4.	≥ 100 k ton/year (Average 5 years).
5.	 Non - Trader (Power Operator).
The main customers (Platinum) continues to grow from 
year to year. In 2012, about 9 companies received platinum 
and the gold criteria received by 29 companies. In 2013 the 
Gold received by 14 companies and the Gold received by 
24 companies.
MARKETING AND PROMOTION 
Given that the Company’s customers are basically corporate 
institutions, marketing and promotion are conducted directly.  
ITM has a marketing approach that builds a common 
perception on the benefit of mutually beneficial, long-term 
relationships.  
To build trust, in addition to holding presentations and 
gatherings, ITM invites and accompanies customers and 
prospective customers to visit the mine sites directly, as well 
as the supporting facilities, such as loading port, jetty and 
docks.  Meanwhile, ITM also approaches prospective buyers 
directly, including making working visits to power plants 
owned by prospective buyers to ensure their feasibility and 
environmental conservation efforts in conducting operations. 
 
Through this intensive approach, the Company’s total coal 
sales volume in 2013 was successfully increased by 6.9% to 
29.1 million tons, up from 2012 sales of 27.2 million tons.  
These sales consisted on 3.2 million tons on the domestic 
market and exports of 25.9 million tons.  
To support and improve the effectiveness of marketing, 
ITM holds an Evaluation Meeting and involves all parts of 
the production and sales supply chain on a routine basis.  
The Evaluation Meeting discusses developments in coal 
market conditions, consumer demands, as well as obstacles 
to production in the field and the transportation process, 
which could impact on sales volume.  The results of these 
discussions are then used as a basis to determine optimum 
production plans and sales strategies. 
MAINTAINING CONSUMER CONFIDENTIALITY 
To date, there has never been a customer complaint related 
to customer privacy violations.  ITM has implemented a 
system to protect customer privacy, including making use of a 
clause in the Confidentiality Agreement in the sales contract 
master with the customer.  To the date of this report, there 
has been no violation of this agreement. 
FINANCIAL IMPLICATIONS RESULTING FROM 
CLIMATE CHANGE 
ITM realizes there are financial implications from climate 
change for the company’s business.  Extreme weather 
conditions at various mine sites can have a detrimental 
effect and cause rising operational costs due to excess water, 
causing heavy equipment to perform at a less than maximum 
level. ITM has also mitigated such risks through detailed mine 
plans that include drainage systems and pumping systems, 
the performance of which is monitored at all times.  
ITM has responded to global climate change concerns by 
constructing Mulut Tambang (mine mouth) steam-driven 
power plant.   With the development of this power plant, the 
CO2 resulting from coal transportation during the production 
process can be minimized.  ITM has also replaced the role of 
its dump trucks to transport coal relatively short distances.  
Electricity generated by the Mulut Tambang power plant is 
used to power the conveyor belt system to transport the coal 
from the mine to the port stockpile area and load it onto the 
barges/ships. 
Through the use of this conveyor belt system, in addition to 
operational costs being more efficient, the environmental 
impact from exhaust gases being emitted by dump trucks will 
also be reduced.

Sustainable Governance
ITM is aware that the practice of good corporate governance (GCG) can help the company realise its vision and 
mission to become an exemplary corporate citizen and a world-class mining company. A strict application of GCG 
plays a significant role in ensuring a company obtains maximum benefit, which later, of course, is beneficial for all 
shareholders. The practice of GCG strengthens a company’s internal conditions, improves performance, improves 
risk management and, finally, enhances its reputation as a winning company. 
On the basis of the above considerations, ITM is committed to incorporating GCG principles and best practice, 
as recommended for open companies. In the same context, we are also committed to complying with all the 
rules, regulations and guidelines relating to the capital market together with all the regulations issued by 
the Financial Services Authority (OJK) and Self-Regulatory Organisations (SROs). Furthermore, ITM strives to 
achieve international standards along with best practice in adopting and applying GCG principles, through the 
implementation of various improvement programs as set out in the GCG Implementation Roadmap.  
GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE
The structure of ITM’s governance illustrates the interaction between the company’s main organs, comprising the 
General Meeting of Shareholders (GMS), the Board of Commissioners and the Board of Directors, and its support 
organs that include the Commissioners’ committees. This governance structure shows two entities resposible 
for implementing the company’s operational management, as is common in Indonesia. This structure confirms a 
commitment to independence within each company organ in carrying out its functions.   
Independence is indicated by the role of each main organ; one of the organisation’s main organs acts as 
supervisor, while the other main organs act as operational executors. Both act on the authority accorded by the 
GMS as a main organ that occupies the highest position in the company. Furthermore, the two other main organs 
(the Board of Commissioners and the Board of Directors) are assisted in exercising their respective authority by 
support organs, which consist of the Committees for the Board of Commissioners and Organisational Tools for the 
Board of Directors.

2013 Sustainability Report
GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS (GMS)
The General Meeting of Shareholders (GMS) is the 
highest organ in ITM’s governance structure. The 
GMS, which operates based on the intent of its 
implementation, consists of an Annual General Meeting 
of Shareholders (AGMS), which routinely discusses 
an agenda once a year, and an Extraordinary General 
Meeting of Shareholders (EGMS), which discusses 
issues outside the routine agenda. An EGMS is held as 
and when needed.   
The GMS is a forum in which shareholders act on an 
equal footing to make important decisions relating 
to capital that has been invested in the company. 
The GMS is also a forum where shareholders make 
significant decisions on the management and 
development of ITM’s business. Through the AGMS and 
EGMS, shareholders can exercise their right to offer 
their opinions and vote in making decisions concerning 
operational results, future development plans and even 
a change in company management. As with the GMS, 
all shareholders – both major and minor - occupy 
positions of equal standing.  
The GMS is used to evaluate the performance of 
the company’s management team, namely the 
Board of Commissioners and the Board of Directors, 
by observing and studying the achievement of 
predetermined performance targets as reflected by 
Key Performance Indicators (KPI). In general, KPI are 
established with clear quantitative and qualitative 
targets derived from company performance measures 
in economic, social, environmental and occupational 
health and safety areas, including other parameters 
such as responsibility for customers, compliance with 
rules and regulations, the perception of ITM among 
capital market investors and so on.    
POSITION OF BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS AND 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
As company executives, the Board of Commissioners 
and the Board of Directors have differing duties and 
authorities that are appropriate to their respective 
functions, as stipulated in the Articles of Association 
and applicable legislation. The Board of Commissioners 
(BoC) acts as a supervisor and monitor of the 
implementation of all GMS decisions, while the Board 
of Directors (BoD) acts as the executor of all those GMS 
decisions. Both entities have fiduciary responsibility.   
As each function must be independent, ITM asserts the 
impartiality of each executive member so as to avoid 
any interference by the Board of Commissioners in 
operational affairs that are within the purview of the 
Board of Directors. 
In order to guarantee supervisory independence, ITM 
provides for the presence of independent members 
on the BoC, with Independent Commissioners making 
up at least 30% of the board’s total members. These 
Independent Commissioners must ensure they have 
no business relationships or any other relations with 
companies that could affect their authority.   
Members of both the Board of Commissioners 
and Board of Directors are elected, appointed and 
dismissed by the GMS. The election of Board of 
Commissioners and Board of Directors members is 
preceded by an eligibility test and a competence test in 
all areas, including social, economic and environmental 
fields, which are carried out by an internal team that is 
specially formed for the purpose and is independent. 
Recommendations produced by this internal team are 
submitted to the GMS for voting and decision-making. 
Determining and Evauating Remuneration for the 
BoC and the BoD
Every year, the Board of Commissioners and the Board 
of Directors have to submit reports on the execution 
of their operations and responsibilities before the 
GMS. During the submission, the various successes 
and challenges faced by the BoC and the BoD in 
carrying out their respective tasks and responsibilities 
are evaluated. The evaluation basically covers the 
company’s performance parameters achieved in social, 
economic and environmental areas. The results of 
the evaluation become the basis for determining the 
remuneration and continuing tenure of each member 
on the BoC and BoD.   
The performance evaluation parameters, or KPI, are 
reviewed and set against each individual operational 
period or term in office, and are accounted for at the 
GMS. Each member on the Board of Commissioners 
and Board of Directors is elected and serves for a 
three-year period, after which time they can be re-
elected. 
The remuneration for members of the BoC and 
BoD is designated based on balancing tasks and 
responsibilities along with performance, market 
feasibility and company capacity. Every member 
on the Board of Commissioners receives a monthly 
honorarium and particular benefits as well as an annual 
82
Sustainable Governance
bonus based on ITM’s achieved performance, which 
is determined in the GMS. Meanwhile, members on 
the Board of Directors receive monthly salaries and 
other benefits as well as an annual bonus based on 
ITM’s performance and achievement. Tax liabilities on 
the BoC and BoD annual bonuses are borne by each 
member.  
Members of the Board of Commissioners and Board 
of Directors also receive facilities and position 
benefits such as vehicle/transport allowances, housing 
allowances, communications allowances, membership 
of clubs/professional associations, legal representation, 
healthcare, insurance, holiday allowances and 
representation allowances. 
ITM assigns the Corporate Governance, Nomination 
and Compensation Committee to draw up 
recommendations for the remuneration of members 
of the BoC and BoD. In carrying out this task, the 
committee can seek input from an independent 
consultant that acts as a resource and is responsible for 
conducting a remuneration survey of the labour market 
regarding similar positions and job responsibilities.  
BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS
The Board of Commissioners is responsible for 
supervising and monitoring ITM’s operational activities, 
ensuring that business is managed in such a way as to 
promote the interests of shareholders and is pursued 
within an ethical framework that considers all relevant 
shareholders. In carrying out its tasks, the BoC is 
guided by the Board of Commissioners’ Charter, which 
came into effect in 2009 and contains explanations on 
areas including the following: 
1.	 Tasks and Responsibilities of the Board of 
Commissioners.
2.	 Provisions on the Composition and Tenure of the 
Board of Commissioners.
3.	 Provisions on the Independence of Commissioners.
4.	 Function, Position and Requirements of 
Independent Commissioners in the Composition of 
the BoC. 
ITM’s BoC currently has six members - led by 
a President Commissioner - two of whom are 
Independent Commissioners. Thus, the percentage of 
Independent Commissioners within the composition 
of the BoC totals 30%, meaning that the composition 
of the Board of Commissioners meets the minimum 
requirement as stipulated in the Law on Limited 
Companies. 
In carrying out its supervisory duties, the BoC submits 
an accountability report on the performance of the 
Board of Directors relating to the latter’s execution of 
the company’s management. The BoC’s Accountability 
Report will be reflected in the approval of the 
Annual Report and endorsement of the company’s 
financial statements by the Annua General Meeting 
of Shareholders AGM. The accountability report also 
includes performance reports in economic, social 
and environmental areas. AGM approval of the 
annual report and the company’s financial statements 
will completely exempt members of the Board of 
Commissioners as long as their actions are reflected in 
the annual report.     
The Board of Commissioners is assisted in executing 
its tasks by two committess that are formed by and 
responsible to the BoC. These committees are the Audit 
Committee and the Corporate Governance, Nomination 
and Compensation Committee. A complete description 
of the functions and duties of each of these committees 
can be found in ITM’s Annual Report 2013. 
BOARD OF DIRECTORS
The Board of Directors is tasked and fully responsible 
collegially for managing the stewardship of ITM’s 
interests in accordance with the founding intent and 
objectives of the company, namely to maximise all the 
resources it possesses. In carrying out its duties, the 
BoD is required to comply with statutory provisions, 
achieve company targets, obey the Company’s Articles 
of Association and execute GMS decisions in good 
faith and maintaining shareholders’ short-term and 
long-term interests as well as all regulatory provisions, 
including those of the Indonesia Stock Exchange (IDX) 
and Financial Services Authority (OJK).    
In executing its tasks, authority and day-to-day 
responsibilities, ITM’s BoD is guided by the Board 
of Directors’ Charter of 2009, which was updated in 
2011. The charter stipulates various things such as the 
following: 
1.	 Tasks and Responsibilities of the Board of Directors.
2.	 Provisions on the Composition and Tenure of the 
Board of Directors.
3.	 Provisions on the Independence of Directors.
4.	 Function, Position and  Functional Tasks in the 
Composition of the BoD. 
The BoD is also guided by a variety of detailed and 
relevant provisions regarding the duties, authority, 
responsibilities and obligations of ITM’s Board of Directors.
83
2013 Sustainability Report
ITM’s Board of Directors currently has six (6) members, who are led by a president director. 
In each period of the implementation of its operational duties, the Board of Directors submits to the AGM an 
accountability report in the form of an annual report that includes operational activities, covering performance 
achievement in economic, social and environmental areas, the implementation of GCG and the company’s financial 
statements for approval and ratification. The BoD’s accountability report will be reflected by the AGM’ approval 
of the annual report and company financial statements, which will exempt members of the BoD as long as their 
actions are reflected in the annual report. 
The performance of the Board of Directors is conducted once every half year with reference to the Key 
Performance Indicators (KPI), which are based on Long-Term Targets (SJP) and One-Year Targets (TST) for the 
current year that are aligned with the company’s mission and vision. Other factors that are assessed include 
economic, social and environmental performance, as well as compliance with best practice and ethical policies.   
CORE GOVERNANCE POLICY
ITM has a GCG Policy, which consists of a series of codes of ethical conduct for conducting business and interacting 
both within the company and with external entities. The GCG Policy, which was compiled to uphold five main 
principles in the application of best governance practice, covers all the company rules that are in force, including 
charters (Board Charters, Audit Charter, Committee Charters and so on), the Code of Conduct, Business Process as 
well as SOPs and Operational Guidelines, as illustrated in the following diagram.

Sustainable Governance
The main corporate governance policy, according to 
content points on the entire series of rules, is as follows. 
Upholding Business Ethics
ITM promotes ethics in conducting business, as 
indicated in the contents of the Board Charters, which 
state that members of the Board of Commissioners 
and Board of Directors must comply with provisions 
concerning:  
•	
Insider information
Members of the BoC as well as members of the BoD 
are prohibited from misusing material information 
relating to company business for their own personal 
interests or those of their families or any other third 
party. 
•	
Confidentiality
Members of the BoC and the BoD must safeguard 
confidential information about the company, 
especially internal information that can affect the 
company’s business and share price. 
•	
Anticorruption
Members of the BoC and BoD must distance 
themselves and are prohibited from accepting 
gratuities or taking personal advantage of company 
business relationships with third parties.  
•	
Conflcts of interest
Members of the BoC and BoD who have a potential 
conflict of interest concerning a particular issue are 
asked to leave meetings when the issue in question 
is being discussed.  
Performance-Based Remuneration
ITM applies a policy of offering performance-based 
remuneration to ensure that all employees at every 
level work to the best of their ability. Promotions and 
rising levels of remuneration will match the results 
of performance assessments, namely predetermined 
individual and team KPI.   
Overall, ITM sets a minimum increase on basic wages 
to meet the annual level of inflation or according to 
the company’s capacity and conditions. Increases in 
allowances and general incentives are appropriate to 
the basic wage of each position category. Meanwhile, 
the scale of accumulated performance-incentive 
bonuses is stipulated in the GMS, together with a 
determination of performance-related annual bonuses 
for members of the Board of Commissioners and Board 
of Directors. 
Internal Supervision and Control
ITM is developing an internal control system that can 
function effectively to safeguard company investments 
and assets from irregularities. The entities responsible 
G4-56
85
2013 Sustainability Report
for internal supervision and control are the Internal 
Audit (SAI) and the External Auditor. 
In order to increase the capacity of SAI staff, they are 
included in training and competence enhancement 
programs on a regular basis so that their knowledge 
and expertise continues to improve. This reflects ITM’s 
efforts to equate itself with international-standard 
practices. 
Risk Management 
ITM is developing an integrated risk management 
system at the corporate level by including each work 
unit. Risk Management development is part of ITM’s 
long-term strategy to form a special work unit that 
identifies, manages and mitigates risk in a systematic 
way, in accordance with risk management standards as 
a reference.  
ITM’s Risk Management process is structured, 
systematic and repeated to improve the performance 
of the company’s risk management, which is sustained 
by a working focus to further increase the intensity 
and quality of risk management to guarantee ITM’s 
continuing business and improved performance.  
INTERNALISATION AND INTEGRATION OF GCG
ITM has devised and is pursuing various programs 
to improve the implementation quality of GCG best 
practice. These programs are collectively known as the 
GCG Implementation Roadmap, which consists of three 
phases and forms the company’s long-term guidelines 
in pursuing its aim to become the best in governance. 
The Roadmap is based on GCG Guidelines issued by 
the National Committee on Governance Policy, and 
refers to the Law on Limited Companies, legislation and 
other guidelines published by the Financial Services 
Authority (OJK) and Self-Regulatory Organisations 
(SROs), as well as other GCG references and best 
practice standards. 
The Roadmap comprises three phases, namely:
•	
Phase 1 
Fulfil all regulations and provisions, both 
compulsory and non-compulsory.
•	
Phase 2
Become a company that is managed effectively 
(both in business processes as well as integrated 
risk management). 
•	
Phase 3
The ultimate aim is to become an exemplary, ethical 
corporate citizen.
In order to ensure the achievement of these goals, 
every year ITM implements a number of GCG 
internalisation activities. In 2013, these activities 
included: 
1.	 implemented a Corporate Governance (CG) writing 
competition.
2.	 campaigned for GCG internalisation.
3.	 established a Transparency Centre.
4.	 performed Independent Whistle Blower Centre 
updates.
5.	 conducted a survey to measure CG understanding.
6.	 published CG Tips on the company’s intranet; and
7.	 supplied a CG portal.
INTERNALISATION OF CODE OF CONDUCT AND 
CORPORATE CULTURE 
ITM has fed its Banpu corporate culture values into 
the rules of the Company’s Code of Conduct, which 
contains various principle provisions including the 
following. 
Compliance with the Code of Conduct
Every year, ITM employees sign a commitment 
statement that declares that they promise to adhere 
to the values and the Company’s Code of Conduct. 
All of ITM’s Commissioners, Directors and employees 
are required to comply with the Company’s Code of 
Conduct to ensure the execution of fair and balanced 
relations with all stakeholders. 
Responsibility towards Shareholders
Shareholders are the owners of this business and ITM 
has an obligation to create long-term values that are 
sustainable for them. All levels of ITM employees are 
required to do their utmost to develop the business 
while creating valuable investment returns for the 
shareholders in a sustainable manner. 
G4-14
86
Sustainable Governance
Compliance with Laws and Regulations as well as 
Related Provisions
ITM is committed to adhering to all prevailing laws, 
regulations and provisions. 
Conflicts of Interest
ITM has established a rule that all ITM personnel are 
prohibited from taking personal advantage beyond 
what is considered their rights and obligations based 
on their working relationship with the company, 
which includes the obligation to avoid any private 
transaction that could give rise to a conflict of interest 
with the company.  
Protection of the Company’s Wealth and Assets
Staff at all levels of ITM must be efficient and 
responsible when utilising company resources and 
assets, as well as caring about the company’s interests 
in order to improve corporate competitiveness and to 
provide the best service to customers. 
Use of Computers and Information Technology (IT)
We must be aware of and comply with all laws, 
including the Information Technology and Electronic 
Transaction Law, which contain policies and procedures 
that are applicable to information networks and 
systems. 
All computers, information technology and information 
facilities, as well as data relating to operations, are 
owned by the company. We may not use computers 
or any other information technology facilities that are 
owned by the company for personal interests. 
We may not disclose user identities or passwords that 
are used to access the company’s information system, 
and so on. 
Anti-bribery and Anticorruption 
Employees at all levels of ITM have a commitment 
to conduct business honestly and ethically, and acts 
of corruption and bribery will not be tolerated, as 
stipulated in the code of conduct guidelines on anti-
87
2013 Sustainability Report
bribery and the banning of accepting gifts, gratuities 
and entertainment. 
Policy and Practice towards Customers
Customer satisfaction is very important for the success 
of the company, so ITM intends to respond to customer 
queries effectively and efficiently, and to continue 
to improve that response in a sustainable way. The 
policies and practical guidelines are as follows: 
Policy and Practice towards Trading Partners and/or 
Creditors 
ITM has a policy to treat its trading partners and/or 
creditors in a fair and equal manner by considering the 
company’s interests and promoting mutual benefits 
for the parties involved. In addition, the policy is also 
intended to avoid a situation that could give rise to a 
conflict of interest.  
Occupational Health and Safety and the 
Environment
ITM is committed to conducting its operations with the 
prioritising of good occupational health, safety and 
environmental conditions. 
Corporate Culture
Corporate culture comprises values and a philosophy 
that have been agreed upon and are trusted by all 
ranks of ITM as a foundation and reference for ITM to 
achieve its goals. ITM has adopted corporate cultural 
values, namely Banpu Spirit, which is defined by four 
principle elements: Innovation, Integrity, Care and 
Synergy (see the section “About ITM”). 
WHISTLE-BLOWING SYSTEM
Aware of the importance of having a whistle-blowing 
system to support the implementation of GCG practice 
in the company, ITM formulated a Whistle-Blowing 
Policy and System (WBS) in 2011. This system was 
originally supported by the Independent Whistle 
Blower Centre (IWBC), which can be accessed on the 
website, www.iwbcitmg.com. In 2013, ITM launched a 
new reporting channel via PO Box 1070 JKS 12010. Thus, 
the WBS can now receive complaints/reports via two 
channels, the website and the PO Box. 
In order that efforts to eradicate fraud and corruption 
via the WBS operate effectively and efficiently, ITM 
has established a number of provisions with the aim 
of encouraging the participation of all employees who 
know of or spot violations. These provisions include: 
Protection Program for Whistle Blowers, Clarifying the 
Scope of a Violation, Handling Mechanism Via the 
IWBC or Via the PO Box.
Results show that, as of the end of 2013, ITM had 
received 42 reports via the IWBC, which were later 
handled by an Ombudsman and investigative 
committee, in accordance with applicable procedures. 
No reports were delivered via the PO Box. Here are the 
details of those reports:

TRANSPARENCY CENTER
In response to growing pressure in corporate circles 
to practise “transparency” in daily business activities 
amid an increasingly widespread anticorruption 
movement worldwide, ITM has formed a medium 
called the Transparency Centre (TC). The TC is used to 
monitor the giving and accepting of gifts, gratuities 
and entertainment, as well as other things that raise the 
possibility of a conflict of interest.  
This medium was launched on September 9, 2013. It 
is in line with one of ITM’s values, namely Integrity, 
and the principle of transparency is also reflected 
in the Company’s GCG policy and Code of Conduct. 
Since its launch, the TC has received more than 
50 reports from ITM employees throughout the 
company’s operational areas.

Sustainable HR Management 
Managing Human Resources Sustainably
ITM believes that Human Resources (HR) are a key to the 
success of a company, as well as being important to an 
organisation’s sustainability. The creation of a working 
environment that is comfortable, safe and conducive 
enables employees to work to their maximum output 
and allows them to believe that their performance and 
dedication will be valued objectively, resulting in them 
receiving compensation that is appropriate along with a 
clear career path. Human resources are also one of the 
stakeholders in a central position as the driving force 
and spearhead of a company’s success in realising its 
vision and executing its mission.   
On the other hand, ITM  views its HR as an important 
business partner, as the presence of employees who 
are professional, competent, dedicated and possessing 
integrity gives us a strong base to continue growing 
and developing to achieve our aims. Therefore, 
in understanding these two important aspects, 
we manage our HR with a focus on imrpoving 
competence, while at the same time striving to fulfil all 
our employees’ expectations.   
To this end, we have established and carried out a 
mission for HR management which aims to provide the 
best HR and HR Management System to support ITM’s 
development. In order to accomplish this mission and 
vision, we have constructed and implemented a basic 
framework on HR management, as well as designing and 
applying various programs on the management of HR. 
During 2013, we put into practice a number of plans 
and programs, especially to align the organisation of 
HR, increase the role of IT in labour administration, 
improve employee competence and recruit new 
employees in a staged process to support ITM in 
achieving its vision and mission.  
PROMOTING GOOD INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS WITH 
WORKERS
ITM seeks to establish a relationship of mutual respect 
and one that is able to achieve a balance between the 
fulfilment of rights and the execution of obligations. This 
kind of impartial relationship is created through intensive 
communication and the involvement of two parties 
that support each other in achieving company targets. 
The two parties here mentioned are the employees, 
who are represented by labour unions, and the 
company’s management. Due to the importance of such 
cooperation, ITM supports the activities of the Labour 
Unions and regular communication in the Bipartite 
Cooperation Agency (LKS).  
This mutually supportive relationship is manifested in 
the points in the agreement and rules contained in the 
Collective Labour Agreement (PKB), which is regularly 
reviewed and updated and is signed by the Labour 
Unions and Management of each company. The same is 
true of the Company Regulations (PP), which are drawn 
up by the Management at given times. Thus, all ITM 
employees (100%) enjoy the full protection of their rights 
through the PKB or PP
. 
With the PKB and PP
, employees’ rights and obligations 
in relation to the company are clear and guaranteed, 
while the documents cover issues such as:  
•	
The certainty of rights and obligations of both the 
Company and Employees, including: the pattern of 
work relations, terms and conditions of employment 
and Company rules.
•	
The setting of dispute settlement, delivery of 
opinions and deliberation procedures.
•	
The setting of employment termination and 
retirement incentives.
•	
Setting remuneration scales and work benefits.
As a form of commitment on the part of ITM, which 
views its employees as a prime asset and key stakeholder 
in guaranteeing the successful achievement of the 
Company’s goals, the Management and Employees 
(through Labour Unions at each subsidiary) have agreed 
and signed the following PKBs or determined the 
following PPs: 
•	
PP for the period September 2012-2014  for PT. Indo 
Tambangraya Megah, Tbk.
•	
PP for the period February 2013-2015 for PT. 
Bharinto Ekatama.
•	
PKB for the period July 2013-2015 for PT. Indominco 
Mandiri.
•	
PKB for the period July 2013-2015 for PT. Jorong 
Barutama Greston.
•	
PKB for the period September 2012 – August 2014 
for PT. Kitadin.
•	
PKB for the period  March 2012–2014 for PT. 
Trubaindo Coal Mining.
These PKBs and PPs are reviewed and renewed every 2 
(two) years in accordance with the prevailing legislation.

2013 Sustainability Report
COMPLIANCE WITH REGULATIONS AND 
LEGISLATION ON EMPLOYEE AFFAIRS 
The several policies regarding ITM’s adherence to labour 
regulations governing the management of employees 
include:
1.	 Freedom of Association
ITM guarantees the right of its employees to 
associate in the form of an employee organisation 
or Labour Union in the company’s structure, 
including the freedom to become its leaders. This 
guaranteed freedom for employees to form a 
Labour Union is contained in Law No. 21/2000 on 
Labour Unions/Trade Unions. This guarantee is also 
stipulated in each of the PKBs and PPs referred to 
above, in Sections and Articles that govern “Labour 
Union Status”.  
Within the ITM structure at this time, eight (8) 
Labour Unions represent all employees at its four (4) 
subsidiaries:
PT. Kitadin 
•	
PT. Kitadin (Embalut) Work Unit Board of the 
Chemical, Energy and Mining Workers Union 
Federation (PUK FSP KEP).
•	
Kitadin Tandung Mayang Workers Union 
(SPKTM).
•	
PT. Kitadin Tandung Mayang Commissariat 
Board of the Energy and Mining Federation-
Indonesian Prosperity Union (PK FPE-SBSI).
•	
PT. Kitadin Tandung Mayang Justice Union.
PT. Indominco Mandiri
•	
Indominco Mandiri Commissariat Board of the 
Indonesian Prosperity Union (PK SBSI).
•	
Indominco Mandiri Workers Union.
PT. Jorong Barutama Greston
•	
PT. Jorong Barutama Greston PUK Chemical, 
Energy and Mining Workers Union All-Indonesia 
Workers Union (SPSI).
PT. Trubaindo Coal Mining
•	
Trubaindo Workers Union (Spektro).
The forms and mechanisms of support offered 
by the Company to the Labour Unions and their 
leaders are organised and guaranteed in the PKBs, 
which are signed by representatives from the 
Labour Unions and those from the Company.  
As the stakeholder that possesses the foremost 
responsibility for maintaining the continuance of 
its business, the Company offers an opportunity 
to its employees – both individually and through 
the Labour Unions at each of its subsidiaries – to 
submit to the Management their proposals for 
improvements, their opinions and constructive 
criticism to improve operations and welfare.The 
Company provides bipartite communication forums 
on a periodic (quarterly) basis at site offices, which 
allow for discussions to resolve any problems that 
may arise in the workplace, so that the relationship 
between the Company and its employees remains 
productive and positive.   
2.	
Working Environment
One of the factors that has a direct impact on 
employee performance is a working environment 
that is healthy, safe and comfortable. The Company 
endeavours to establish a physical and mental 
environment surrounding work activities that is 
conducive to a positive work atmosphere. In order 
to build a healthy psychological environment 
and establish intensive communication with 
management, the Company provides regular 
consultative forums that can be attended by 
Labour Union representatives as well as individual 
employees. 
Meanwhile, to establish harmonious relationships 
among its employees, the Company provides an 
Information Technology-based communication 
tool that allows all employees to communicate fully 
during their work shifts. The Company has even 
launched a program to support employees’ off-duty 
activities, such as membership of fitness centres, 
family gatherings and employee get-togethers 
as well as providing fully-eqipped infrastructure 
at its remote mining sites, such as sporting and 
entertainment facilities.      
92
Sustainable HR Management 
Through these various measures, ITM manages 
to maintain a conducive work environment and 
atmosphere, producing a level of satisfaction for its 
employees in their work; a fact that is indicated by the 
relatively low staff turnover rates.  
Total Number of Company Employees who entered 
retirement/resigned/chose early retirement. During the 
reporting period, there was an employee turnover rate 
of 8.0%, with a total of 258 employees (215 men and 
43 women) leaving the company. The cause of these 
departures was generally based on personal reasons, 
early retirement and entering the age of retirement.     
Also during the reporting year, ITM recruited 126 new 
employees through a number of recruitment programs, 
which were conducted alone and in cooperation with 
competent parties.
3.	
Working Hours and Significant Operational 
Changes
ITM applies limits on employee working hours so 
as not to exploit the workforce, bearing in mind 
the areas and nature of the work. In accordance 
with the nature of the business, which demands 
consistency in delivering to consumers, the 
Company puts into effect regular working hours, 
shift work and special working hours for the 
execution of work in specific areas. In the event that 
in order to complete a job, an employee exceeds 
the pre-agreed working hours, then compensation 
is given in the form of overtime in accordance 
with the law, while days off in lieu are provided for 
several classes of employees.   
ITM allows Employees to enjoy annual leave 
entitlements, that some locations include 
field breaks for Employees who have worked 
consecutively for a particular length of time. The 
Company also allows its Women Employees to take 
maternity leave, and the Company guarantees them 
the chance to return to their original positions in 
recognition of their rights. During 2013, twenty-one 
(21) Women Employees took maternity leave and 
thereafter returned to work in the company.  
The same guarantees are also accorded to 
Employees who perform the Haj, during which time 
they continue to enjoy their rights as Employees. 
During 2013, three (3) employees performed the Haj 
and then returned to work. 
4.	
Wage Determination
ITM provides wages for work services performed 
by both permanent and temporary employees, the 
components of which include a fixed salary, vacation 
money, gratuities for exemplary employees, 
performance incentives, bonuses and other benefits. 
The scale of these wages is reviewed at certain 
intervals. 
The minimum wage paid to new ITM employees at 
entry level is greater than the regional minimum 
wage (UMR) or provincial minimum wage (UMP) 
where our main sites are located.  
In terms of workforce remuneration, the Company 
does not differentiate on the basis of gender 
between male and female employees.
following is an Entry-Level Wage Comparison Table in 
relation to the local UMR according to Operational Area.

5.	
Prevention of Child Labour and Prohibition of Forced Labour
ITM pays great attention to the prevention of child labour. The minimum age requirement for prospective 
employees with ITM is 18. This requirement also applies to our mining contractor partners. It is adhered to and 
monitored closely, with the result that during the reporting period, no minors were employed by the ITM Group 
or by our mining partners. This is consistent with the Government’s decision to ratify various regulations on 
Human Resources, particularly the International Labour Organization (ILO) Convention.  
ITM utilises a shift-work system in several areas of its operations. Shifts are adapted to conditions encountered 
in the field, comprising 2 to 3 shifts a day, while excessive work hours are calculated as overtime as contained 
in the PKB and in accordance with the Law. During working hours, each employee is given the chance to take 
a break at certain hours. This system is intended to prevent and negate any actions that could be categorised 
as forced labour.
6.  	 Respecting the Rights of Indigenous Peoples
ITM always respects the rights of local populations, with the result that during the reporting period, no incidents 
or violence were instigated by ITM towards communities living around the company’s mining operational areas. 
Likewise, no refusals were lodged by these communities concerning ITM’s operational activities. 
We have a vision of being a company that is committed to empowering communities through partnerships, 
working together in a sustainable way and with initiative to empower communities to become self-reliant. 
We consistently apply ITM’s community development policy, which is inspired by the Banpu Spirit - our corporate 
culture that consists of four values, namely Innovation (creating and developing independent communities), 
Integrity (a commitment towards communities), Care (providing support irrespective of differences) and Synergy 
(working together in partnerships comprising the communities, local governments and the company).  
In carrying out our mining operations, from the acquisition of land, mining the coal through to closing a mine, 
we strive to involve the active participation of local communities when discussing the process of land and crop 
replacement, determining relocation sites and seeking livelihoods, which is a realisation of our greening program 
as well as our corporate social responsibilty (CSR) program. 
COMPANY EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHICS
At the end of the reporting year, the total number of ITM employees was 3.144, assigned across 9 main operational 
sites, comprising two (2) operational offices (Headquarters in Jakarta and Branch Office in Balikpapan) and seven (7) 
sites managed by five (5) subsidiaries. Of this total number of employees, 367 are non-permanent staff employed on 
Fixed-Term Contracts (PKWT), while the remainder are permanent employees.

In accordance with the company’s operational business in the mining sector, the majority of ITM employees 
(92.5%) work in Kalimantan, while 7.5% of employees – 227 people – work in Java, namely at the Jakarta 
headquarters office. 
We do not set percentage limits on the number of employees based on gender. In accordance with the nature of 
the work involved in mining, the number of women employees is smaller than that of men. Most of our women 
employees work in administration and areas that support the field operations. 
G4-10

2013 Sustainability Report
Management of Competence AND CAREER 
DEVELOPMENT
Considering that HR are a company’s business partner 
in achieving its long-term goals and is, at the same time, 
a stakeholder that plays a central role in supporting 
the successful attainment of those goals, we have 
developed a management system that incorporates both 
these HR roles. Given that basic competence among 
HR is the primary capital in HR management, ITM’s HR 
Management System is directed towards the upstream, 
from recruiting the best candidates with work experience 
and solid educational backgrounds who appreciate 
values similar to our Shared Corporate Values (Banpu 
Spirit).   
ITM also involves employees in implementing a 
Performance Management System through the 
alignment of individual targets with the Company’s 
Strategic Objectives. Determining these objectives 
is achieved by using SMART (Specific, Measurable, 
Achievable, Realistic, Time-bound) criteria, where all staff 
approve the work targets set to support the company’s 
aims, including a schedule of periodic evaluations to be 
carried out at a later date.  
In light of the fact that ITM runs operations in several 
locations in Indonesia, we have devised an HR 
administrative system that can accommodate directives 
from headquarters, while also respecting conditions 
in regional areas, thus ensuring the establishment of 
a practical HR management that is both effective and 
acceptable to all parties at every operational location.  
The structure of ITM’s HR management is an 
organisational structure that reflects a clear chain of 
command while, at the same time, reflecting the links 
between employees as part of the organisation in light 
of their respective responsibilities. This management 
system is able, therefore, to incorporate the adoption 
of policies, standards, guidelines and the supervision 
of staff movements, as well as career development and 
travel arrangements, complete with control over policy 
being delegated to authorities in each section.    
In order to support HR management across regions 
and HR activities, ITM has identified, designed and 
developed a Human Resources Information System; an 
Internet web-based system that enables management to 
record data, conduct analysis and compile reports on the 
implementation of HR management. This entire system 
is designed to ensure that ITM’s HR are the company’s 
business partner in achieving the company’s aims and 
realising its vision and mission. 
Recruitment 
The recruitment of ITM employees is generally open 
to anyone. In order to attract high-quality candidates, 
ITM applies several recruitment methods. One of 
these programs, which is conducted regularly, is the 
Geological & Engineer Trainee (GET) program. The most 
recent GET program, namely the sixth intake, began on 
March 11, 2013, and ended on March 10, 2014. Through 
this program, ITM recruits new university graduates, 
in cooperation with a number of Indonesia’s leading 
universities, so that they may be trained and developed 
to become prospective company leaders in the future. 
In 2013, ITM recruited seven (7) employees, five (5) of 
whom were students who received scholarships from 
ITM’s collaboration with several State Universities in 
Indonesia.  
They subsequently underwent a development program, 
according to which they spent two (2) months in Jakarta 
and 10 months on-the-job training in the field, where 
they were given project assigments and regularly 
assessed by mentors. The final results of this program 
were presented before field management personnel, 
Headquarters Office Management and Directors at the 
beginning of March 2014.  
96
Sustainable HR Management 
At the same time, a regular recruitment process takes 
place in the normal way, with the receipt of applications 
preceded by posting job vacancies in various media 
outlets and on the Company’s website. Most of the 
applicants who follow the admissions process and are 
later accepted as prospective employees are highly-
talented local residents who come from cities or areas 
in which ITM operates. If all the requirements and 
selection critera are met, ITM prioritises the enrollment 
of prospective employees from local areas. The same 
approach is adopted in the selection of senior managers, 
where through to the end of the reporting year, senior 
managers who came from the local population (namely, 
from Kalimantan) totaled 26, making up 21% of ITM’s 
total senior managers (Level Manager on up).   
Before being taken on as permanent staff, new 
employees must undergo basic training, followed by 
the implementation of development programs for 
new employees that have successfully completed the 
selection process, according to their respective 
work areas.
As already mentioned, via its tiered selection process, 
ITM accepted 126 new employees in 2013.  
Competence Training and Development
ITM puts its employee competence development 
program into practice based upon a Competence Model. 
All the development activities are conducted through 
formal Workshops, comprising In-Class Training, Self-
Learning (which includes E-Learning), Sharing Sessions 
(sessions on sharing information or knowledge) and 
On-the-Job Training, which are synchronised with the 
Performance Management System through guidance by 
supervisors in each work unit.   
The training and development plan is designed so that 
in each year of formal training in these areas, key focus 
is given to enhancing managerial skills, operational skills 
and behaviour. For senior managers, the development 
plan includes leadership and entrepreneurship, while 
the development plan for middle managers focuses 
on professional knowledge and people management. 
Technical knowledge and continual improvement is 
stressed for both professional and operational staff. 
In order to help develop these levels of competence, ITM 
has also built relationships with several major universities 
to provide scholarships for talented employees, allowing 
them to further their education at university. In 2013, 
ITM gave an opportunity to six (6) employees to enter 
this scholarship program. ITM also offered internships to 
high school students and university students. 
So as to offer a training program that is directional, 
structured and systematic, ITM has compiled 
a Technical Training Roadmap to ensure the 
implementation of a training program that is in line 
with the career management system. The training 
modules for the Technical Training Roadmap are 
created with the involvement of the company’s 
internal resources so as to produce training material 
appropriate to the company’s operations, which can 
then be implemented in daily work. 
In conducting the training and development program, 
ITM applies a principle of harmony among all 
employees, with no distinction made to gender. 
In 2013, ITM executed no fewer than 232 types of 
training, 97 of which were conducted as in-house 
training, while the 135 others were external training, 
with the number of participants totalling 2,180 
employees. The total number of training hours reached 
22,824 for male participants and 3,763 for women 
participants. The recapitulation of training carried out 
by ITM is as follows.

Performance Management System
ITM has also developed a Performance Management 
System, which allows employees to determine their 
respective performance targets appropriate to their roles 
and responsibilities at ITM.
ITM assesses employee performance in a transparent 
and accountable way using elctronic and non-
electronic forms of media. Performance assessments 
are carried out periodically by the Employees 
themselves, as well as direct and indirect Supervisors. 
The performance assessment results are used as a 
basis for program development, remuneration, career 
development and promotions. 
Assessments are conducted throughout each employee’s 
period of employment, as part of a pattern of employee 
career development based on competence. Follow-up 
assessments on performance and competence feed 
into the planning and implementation of development 
programs, rotations, transfers and promotions. 
Performance assessments are later followed by 
measuring the competence of employees, who are then 
promoted or moved up in the organisation’s hierarchy. In 
2013, ITM measured the competence of 844 employees. 
Thereafter, ITM promoted and rotated a number of 
employees based on demonstrable work achievements; 
433 employees were promoted and 89 were rotated.

Career Path Equality
ITM guarantees equal opportunities for all its employees 
in developing their careers, in accordance with its 
development efforts. The consistent application of the 
principle of equality at all levels in the organisation 
prevents any case of discrimination on the basis of 
ethnicity, race, religion, gender or political affiliation. 
All employees can accept the decisions of their Bosses 
to place them in particular roles or positions, as these 
decisions are based on data detailing competence and 
ITM’s predetermined criteria.  
BENEFITS PACKAGE
The Company applies competitive salary standards 
that are in line with its financial capability. To that end, 
the Company always participates in remuneration 
surveys conducted by leading remuneration 
consultants. This is done in an effort to standardise 
the Company’s compensation and rewards system 
to motivate employees to improve their competence 
and performance, as well as retaining employees with 
potential.   
The Company remunerates all its employees every 
month as compensation for their work, according to 
their functions and positions.

Recognition Program 
Gender Equality in Remuneration
ITM does not recognise a gender difference in the awarding of remuneration. The same is true with regard to career 
development, in which the Company provides standard wages or equal pay to both its male and female employees 
without discrimination. Salary differences are not ascertained by differences in gender; they are based solely on an 
individual’s position, performance and length of service.

Pension Plan
ITM provides a pension plan for permanent staff so that when an employee retires, he or she can continue to enjoy a 
quality of life that is secure and assured. ITM participates in the Seniors’ Security (JHT) program run by 
PT. Jamsostek, in which ITM contributes 3.7% and each employee 2%. 
Early Retirement Plan

claim special retirement in agreement with the Company, according to the following conditions:
1.	 Must have worked for a minimum of 10 (ten) years and be 40 (forty) years old or over, or;
2.	 Must have worked for 20 (twenty) years for the ITM Group.

Furthermore, in order to prepare employees who are 
facing full-time service, ITM organises entrepreneurship 
training, which includes inviting former ITM employees 
who have established their own businesses to be training 
resources.

ITM organises a program that presents awards to

ENHANCING CORPORATE CULTURE
The work culture at ITM comprises the Company’s values 
(Innovation, Integrity, Care, Synergy) and is commonly 
referred to as Banpu Spirit. The Banpu Spirit includes 
shared values that must be practised/realised in carrying 
out the day-to-day tasks in ITM’s work environment.  
The Banpu Spirit Corporate Culture emphasises the 
importance of employee motivation and performance. 
In order to enhance vigour in the application of 
the Banpu Spirit culture, ITM puts it into practice 
in a number of programs such as the following:
