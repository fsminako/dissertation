Environmental Management
ICMM Principles: 
Environmental Performance 
Conservation of Biodiversity 
Responsible Production
In line with the commitment to 
sustainability in environmental 
management to support Net Zero Emission 
(NZE) from scope 1 and scope 2 by 2050, 
PT Vale focuses on implementing new 
renewable energy (EBT) to reduce carbon 
emissions with a target of reducing carbon 
emissions by 33% by 2030. The entire 
development project has undergone a 
comprehensive risk management process in 
social and environmental aspects, including 
the preparation of an Environmental 
Impact Analysis (AMDAL) document. This 
process ensures that potential impacts 
are thoroughly assessed, and appropriate 
measures are implemented to mitigate 
adverse effects on the environment.
In 2023, the Company also initiated 
the construction of a nursery for the 
Indonesia Growth Project (IGP) in Pomalaa, 
Kolaka Regency, Southeast Sulawesi. The 
nursery facility spans five hectares and 
has a capacity to produce one million plant 
seedlings annually, including endemic 
plant species from Southeast Sulawesi. 
The nursery is designed to support post-
mining reclamation in the Pomalaa Block 
and other reclamation needs in Kolaka.

We aim to continue our presence and 
contribute positively to the community, 
including creating more job opportunities. 
In 2023, PT Vale initiated the construction 
of a nickel processing plant or smelter 
in Bahodopi, Morowali Regency, Central 
Sulawesi, and an HPAL plant in Malili, 
East Luwu Regency, South Sulawesi. 
These projects are expected to generate 
employment for 12,000-15,000 workers. 
PT Vale is committed to maximizing 
local employment and enhancing 
competencies through workforce training.
Another benefit of PT Vale’s existence is 
that it contributes to the state through 
tax payments and non-tax state revenue 
(NTSR). The value of the Company’s 
payments for central tax obligations and 
NTSR managed by the Directorate General 
of Taxes, the Ministry of Energy and 
Mineral Resources as well as the Ministry of 
Environment and Forestry, and the Ministry 
of Transportation for the period 2011-2023 
reached US$1,614 million. Meanwhile, local 
tax payments to provincial and regency/
city government treasuries at PT Vale’s 
work locations for the 2011-2023 period 
reached US$267 million, while the 2022-
2023 period reached US$58 million.

community and 
those involved in the 
Company’s operations.
Transforming the  
future by taking care  
of the present. 
We are generating

well-being for society and 
permanent environmental 
preservation mechanisms. 
Creating a better world than 
before PT Vale establishment. 
Putting the benefits intrinsic 
to mining at the service 
of society as a whole. 
In addition, we use the 
knowledge, human resources, 
and technical, financial and 
catalytic capacity that PT 
Vale has developed over the 
years to rebuild a virtuous 
cycle of prosperity that 
points to an inclusive and 
comprehensive future, in

Sustainability  
Performance
PT Vale is committed to managing and protecting the 
environment by implementing an Environmental Management 
System in accordance with ISO 14001:2015 standards, as well 
as the Principles of Sustainable Mining Management based 
on the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM) 
Sustainable Development Framework. Environmental policies 
on energy efficiency, emission reduction, waste management, 
water efficiency, pollution reduction, and biodiversity 
conservation further support the Company’s commitment. 
EMS implementation ensures consistency in environmental 
management through resource allocation, responsibility 
assignment, and ongoing evaluation integrated with the 
Company’s business processes. Additionally, the commitment 
to environmental management is supported by policies to 
consult stakeholders, including public consultations for the 
preparation of AMDAL documents, Environmental Monitoring 
Plans (RPL), and Environmental Management Plans (RKL) 
related to the implementation of several IGP projects. [2-25]
We continually enhance environmental regulatory compliance 
by implementing the Regulation Compliance System application 
and address environmental improvements through the 
implementation of PRO-027476-Preliminary Risk Analysis and 
Aspects Assessment and SP10 Change Management. These 
efforts are integral to the Company’s strategy to mitigate 
the impacts of mining operations on the environment in 
accordance with the stages of activities conducted in each 
operational area, namely the Sorowako, and Bahodopi blocks. 
Operational activities include various stages such as land 
clearing, ore excavation, transportation, stockpiling, screening, 
and land rehabilitation. The environmental impacts of these 
operations include risks such as Greenhouse Gas (GHG) 
emissions, waste disposal, and energy consumption which can 
disrupt ecosystem balance and environmental sustainability.  
We routinely monitor and measure our environmental 
management performance and communicate any constraints 
or challenges in environmental management to find the 
best solutions. PT Vale has mechanisms to transparently 
address and communicate any environmental management 
issues and report environmental management performance 
through ESG-related publications on the Company’s website, 
as well as periodic reporting to relevant authorities.

Sustainability Report 2023
GHG emissions are calculated at Sorowako operations, covering scope 1 emissions from 
production activities and fuel consumption, as well as scope 2 emissions from electricity 
usage. PT Vale has not yet calculated scope 3 emissions, however we have plans to do so in 
the near future. The calculation results are expressed as total GHG emissions in metric tons 
of CO₂eq, including the conversion of non-CO₂ GHG emissions (CH₄, N₂O, and HFC). Biogenic 
CO₂ emissions are not included in the calculation. The calculation is based on the energy 
consumption balance method from fossil fuels and greenhouse gas-causing gases with a 
baseline year of 2017, a Global Warming Potential (GWP) index of 1, and the guidelines of 
the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) with GWP index referring to the 
assessment of the fifth report in 2014 (AR-5). [305-1][305-2][305-3] 
GHG emissions in 2023 are 2,032,313 ton CO₂eq. This value has increased from the 2017 
baseline, in line with the 17.7% increase in nickel in matte production volume. However, 
based on emission intensity, we experienced a decrease in 2023 by 1.1% compared to 2022. 
Going forward, the Company continues to seek breakthroughs to meet its commitment to 
reduce scope one and two absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 33% by 2030, and 
towards NZE by 2050.

The low intensity of GHG emissions by PT Vale is supported by three hydropower plants, 
capable of avoiding additional scope 1 carbon emissions equivalent to 1,118,231 tons of CO2eq 
per year if calculated based on the volume of diesel fuel usage for diesel power plants; 
and equivalent to 2,292,375 tons of CO2eq per year using coal for steam power plants. We 
continue to develop opportunities to reduce GHG emissions from production processes with 
a potential of 1,800 kilotons of CO2eq, or 90% of total GHG emissions. Other opportunities 
arise from mining areas with a potential GHG emissions reduction of 200 kilotons of CO2eq.

PT Vale implements efficiency measures using a model-based controller 
to maintain gas temperature stability in the Reduction Kiln. This 
controller automatically adjusts the addition and/or reduction of 
Marine Fuel Oil (MFO) based on the actual gas temperature compared 
to the operational target. Operators only need to set the desired gas 
temperature, and the system efficiently regulates the rate of MFO 
addition and/or reduction.
Modular Screening 
Station
Two Modular Screening Station (MSS) units, namely MSS 12 and MSS 13, 
are currently undergoing trials before regular operation. The potential 
reduction in Greenhouse Gas emissions from regular operation is 
estimated at 5,000 tons of CO2eq per year.

emissions through monitoring and calculation to comply with the quality standards outlined 
in Minister of Environment Regulation No. 4 of 2014 concerning Emission Quality Standards 
for Non-Moving Sources in Mining Activities. Calculations employ a mass balance method, 
determining emission intensity by comparing the weight of emitted SO2 with the weight of 
the resulting products, expressed in tons of SO2 per ton of Ni. The results for 2023 show that 
the SO2 Emission Intensity value remains below the quality standard threshold of 0.80 tons

Energy Consumption and 
Efficiency [POJK51-F.6] 
Energy consumption calculation encompasses 
the volume of energy usage within the Company, 
including heavy equipment operation in nickel ore 
mining operations and nickel in matte production 
processes. We have not calculated energy 
consumption outside the Company. The energy 
consumed is sourced from hydropower plant 
electricity supply, which constitutes renewable 
energy, as well as thermal power plants and the 
use of fossil fuels, which are non-renewable 
energy sources. The total energy consumption 
calculation involves summing the volume of 
energy sources used, which is then converted 
to Gigajoules (GJ) using the International Energy 
Agency (IEA) conversion factor. [302-1][302-2] 
Total energy consumption in 2023 amounted 
to 30,974,878 GJ, representing a 14.9% increase 
from 2022, which stood at 26,689,441 GJ. 
Renewable energy usage from hydropower 
plants accounted for 8,791,124 GJ or 28.4% of 
the total energy usage, while energy usage from 
B30 Biodiesel until March amounted to 500,552 
GJ then starting April changed to Biodiesel B35 
amounting to 1,741,583 GJ, from the total use of 
biodiesel B30 and B35 amounted to 2,244,136 GJ 
or 7.2% of the  total energy requirements. The 
remaining 19,939,619 GJ, or 64.4%, came from 
non-renewable energy sources, with the largest 
volume coming from Marine Fuel Oil (MFO) usage 
totaling 10,295,322 GJ. [302-1][EM-MM-130a.1]

In 2023, the rehabilitation conducted by PT Vale entered the 
second-year planting and maintenance phase (P2). To ensure the 
success of the program, the Company, together with stakeholders, 
conducted Gemba or field visits to Lappa Laona Village, one of 
the watershed rehabilitation sites in Barru Regency. During the 
Gemba activities, stakeholders provided suggestions for improving 
the implementation of second-year planting and maintenance, 
adjusting technical designs according to site conditions, and 
replacing seedling types. We are committed to enhancing the 
success of watershed rehabilitation before handing over the 
green land to the Government. The success criteria for watershed 
rehabilitation are agroforestry with the number of stands 
reaching 400 trees per hectare, intensive with the number of 
stands reaching 625 to 1,100 trees per hectare, and the level of 
growing plants and healthy plants is more than 75 percent of the 
number of initial plants.
The watershed rehabilitation program in West Java Province 
conducted by PT Vale will continue until 2025. As of the end 
of 2023, the planting realization covered an area of 435 Ha, 
including regions in West Java Province, comprising 191 Ha in 
Sumedang Regency, 209 Ha in Tasikmalaya Regency, and 35 Ha in 
Pangandaran Regency.
In addition to the planting realization by the end of 2023, there 
was also the implementation of second-year plant maintenance 
(P2) covering an area of 10,000 ha, spanning across 13 regencies in 
South Sulawesi Province. The watershed rehabilitation activities 
aim to restore, maintain, and enhance watershed functions, 
including environmental conservation, by planting various types 
of timber and non-timber forest products (NTFPs) according to 
site suitability. Furthermore, watershed rehabilitation activities 
can improve the welfare of communities living around the forest 
by promoting sustainable forest management practices.
The mining operations area of PT Vale is privately owned under a 
Contract of Work with the Government of Indonesia, which was 
amended in 2014. Some parts of the operational area are located 
within protection forest areas. We have obtained Borrow-to-
Use Forest Permits (IPPKH) from the Ministry of Environment 
and Forestry regarding the use of protection forest areas. In 
addition, the area of operation is not in an active conflict area.

through identification and relocation to other 
locations, including post-mining rehabilitation 
areas. In 2023, the reclaimed mining land reached 
224.4 Ha, achieving 86.3% of the targeted 260 Ha. 
We aim to complete the reclamation and 
rehabilitation of land totaling over 10,000 hectares 
by the year 2024. Gradually, the rehabilitated 
land will be handed over to the Government for 
reforestation purposes. [304-2][304-3][MM1]
PT Vale is committed to conserving protected and 
endangered species of fauna and flora. A joint study 
conducted with Hasanuddin University in 2020 
identified 43 protected species listed on the IUCN Red 
List within the mining operation area of Sorowako 
Block. The list of these species can be found in the 
Appendix. Until the end of 2023, these species are still 
found in the Sorowako Block. [304-4][MM2]
As part of PT Vale’s commitment to biodiversity 
conservation, the Company has established the 
Sawerigading Wallacea Biodiversity (Kehati) Park, 
serving as a conservation area for flora and fauna, an 
educational hub for biodiversity, a recreational space, 
and a jogging track. The park was inaugurated on March 
30, 2023, by President Joko Widodo. 
In addition to providing a new habitat for plant species, 
the Sawerigading Wallacea Biodiversity Park is home to 
30 deer and serves as a breeding ground for endemic 
butterflies. The facilities of the Sawerigading Wallacea 
Biodiversity Park cover an area of 15 Ha and are 
integrated with a nursery center.
Reducing Landfill  
Loads Together
We are committed to comprehensive and sustainable 
environmental management. Following the framework of 
the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), the 
Company focuses on reducing landfill burden as part of its 
environmental management efforts.
PT Vale is committed to achieving zero waste to landfill 
by 2025, five years ahead of the government’s target. This 
goal will be achieved by optimizing waste management 
practices across mining operations, production processes, 
and support activities. Solid waste generation includes both 
hazardous (B3) and non-hazardous waste. Prior to disposal, 
waste management involves efforts to reduce, reuse, recycle, 
and recover materials (4R principles). The hazardous waste 
management is handed over to a third party that already has 
a KLHK license. As for medical waste, incineration is carried 
out using a generator and the ashes are handed over to a 
third party. Waste-related data collection is reported in 
Simple and SiRaja. During the reporting period, no hazardous 
waste was sent internationally and there were no spills 
of waste materials that endangered the environment. In 
addition, PT Vale uses Reduction Kiln Electric Furnice (RKEF) 
so that it does not generate tailings. [POJK51-F.13][POJK51-F.14]

Regency Government 
to Stop the Use of 
Plastic Bags. Through 
this agreement, PT 
Vale encourages its 
employees, their families, 
and contractor workers 
to reduce and eliminate 
the use of plastic bags.
	 PT Vale utilized organic 
waste as feed for 
maggots and organic 
compost, reducing 
organic waste by 57.8 
tons. The resulting 
compost is reused by PT 
Vale as a planting medium 
for seedling development 
in the nursery.
	 PT Vale applied the 
principles of a circular 
economy by donating 
recyclable waste to the 
East Luwu waste bank.
	 Additionally, PT Vale 
empowered communities 
by providing guidance 
on waste bank 
management. Currently, 
there are 16 waste 
banks distributed across 
the Nuha and Towuti 
sub-districts, reducing 
waste to landfills by 
18.4 tons per year.
To achieve the zero waste to landfill target, PT Vale implemented 
several supporting activities during 2023:
	 PT Vale actively 
participated in raising 
awareness about the 
importance of waste 
management through 
events such as National

Reducing Water 
Consumption Intensity 
Together [POJK51-F.8]
Aligned with mining practices in accordance with the International Council 
on Mining and Metals (ICMM) Sustainable Development Framework, 
PT Vale is committed to reducing water consumption intensity. This 
commitment is realized through the implementation of the Water 
Efficiency and Wastewater Pollution Load Reduction Policy. The policy can 
be viewed at https://vale.com/our-policy.
Water Consumption 
Intensity Reduction
The largest water requirement is for the 
operation of the Larona Hydropower Plant 
on the Larona River, with water sources 
from Lakes Matano, Mahalona, and 
Towuti. Water from the lakes is directed 
to reservoirs at dams and then channeled 
to turbines. The amount of water 
consumed equals the water taken from 
the lakes, and no water is withdrawn from 
areas of water stress [303-3] 
Lakes Matano, Mahalona, and Towuti 
also serve as local residents‘ sources for 
domestic needs, livelihoods such as fishing 
and farming, and transportation activities. 
PT Vale regulates the volume and flow 
of water for hydropower plant purposes 
to ensure the lakes‘ preservation, 
thus maintaining their usability by the 
community. Commitment to preserving 
these lakes also supports their status as 
Conservation Areas of Nature Tourism 
Parks, based on Minister of Agriculture 
Decree No.274/Kpts/Um/4/1979 dated 
April 24, 1979.  [303-1][303-2][EM-MM-210b.1] 
Total annual water usage during 2023 
reached 7,561,108 m3 which is equivalent 
to 7,561.1 Megaliters, a decrease of 11% 
from 2022 which reached 8,519,762 m3 
which is equivalent to 8,519.8 Megaliters. 
The Water Consumption Intensity value 
in 2023 was 106.9 m3/ton Ni (0.1069 
Megaliters/ton Ni), lower than 2022‘s 
141.77 m3/ton Ni, or 0.14 Megaliters/ton

Wastewater Impact and 
Management[POJK51-F.9][POJK51-F.14]
PT Vale is deeply committed to preventing water pollution 
near our operations, including Lake Matano. We regularly 
analyze treated effluent that will be discharged into 
tributaries leading to Lake Matano. These analyses aim 
to ensure compliance with water quality standards as 
stipulated in Minister of Environment Regulation No. 
9 of 2006 regarding Wastewater Quality Standards for 
Nickel Ore Mining Activities. These analyses are carried 
out by accredited independent laboratories using the 
SNI 6989.59:2008 Water and Wastewater method and 
American Public Health Association (APHA) standard 
methods. Based on the examinations conducted in 
2023, it was found that the quality of treated effluent 
met the required standards. [303-4][EM-MM-140a.2]
Studies conducted in PT Vale’s mining area in Sorowako have 
concluded that there is no potential for the formation of acid 
mine drainage by the end of 2023 due to the absence of rocks 
capable of generating acid mine drainage within the mining 
site. Acid mine drainage represents a notable environmental 
concern in mining activities, including nickel ore mining, 
as it can lead to adverse effects on the environment. 
Of particular concern is its potential to contaminate 
water bodies such as rivers, lakes, and groundwater.

Partner Evaluation [POJK51-F.16]
In managing the environment, PT Vale 
adheres to all applicable regulations. We 
utilize the Regulation Compliance System 
(RCS) application and implement global 
standards related to regulation compliance, 
enabling the Company to access and 
identify compliance levels. Environmental 
management performance is also evaluated 
by the Environment Committee composed of 
Senior Managers and the Board of Directors. 
The Company collaborates with independent 
parties such as Bureau Veritas, as external 
auditors to evaluate environmental 
performance, with a compliance rate of 
100% for 2023. We ensure that there are no 
suspicions of environmental mismanagement, 
thereby mitigating any risk of fines or other 
legal sanctions for PT Vale. [2-27] 
As part of the Company’s environmental 
management compliance, PT Vale conducts 
Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) to launch 
and socialize the complaint mechanism regarding PT Vale’s 
activities in the Tanamalia Block. FGD participants include 
local government officials, representatives from the Ministry 
of Environment and Forestry (KLHK) and the Ministry of 
Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM), Commissioners of 
the National Commission on Human Rights (Komnas HAM), 
environmental activists, and representatives from youth 
and women’s groups. Through the FGDs, PT Vale and all 
stakeholders agree to seek solutions to common concerns 
arising from exploration activities in the Tanamalia Block.
Environmental Management 
Performance Evaluation Towards 
Suppliers/Partners
PT Vale periodically evaluates the environmental management 
performance of its suppliers/partners. In 2023, evaluations

Commitment to Human Rights
Human rights are important for PT Vale in conducting 
sustainable business operations. As part of Vale 
Global, we have a Human Rights Policy formulated in 
compliance with international principles and standards, 
including the United Nations Guiding Principles on 
Business and Human Rights, Universal Declaration 
of Human Rights, United Nations Declaration on the 
Rights of Indigenous Peoples, Voluntary Principles 
on Security and Human Rights, International Council 
on Mining and Metals, and International Finance 
Corporation Performance Standards. Other global 
frameworks include the Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs), ISO 26000 Corporate Social Responsibility 
Guidelines, ISO 14001:2015 Environmental 
Management System, and United Nations Global 
Compact (UNGC) membership. [2-23][EM-MM-210a.3]  
 PT Vale upholds the principles of respecting, 
protecting, and remedying human rights within the 
Company by implementing a hierarchical mitigation 
approach to prevent human rights violations. 
Additionally, we provide mechanisms for complaint 
and violation reporting, listening and responding 
mechanisms, conducting human rights assessments, 
and imposing sanctions in case of human rights 
violations, including those involving suppliers. 
Throughout 2023, PT Vale encountered no reports 
regarding human rights violations.  [2-23][EM-MM-210a.3]  
Tanamalia Project 
Human Rights 
Training
In 2023, our commitment to human rights was 
manifested through a human rights training 
held on December 12-13, 2023, attended by 
all teams involved in the Tanamalia Project 
in the Tanamalia Block, Towuti Sub-district, 
East Luwu Regency. PT Vale organized the 
training session with AsM Law Office Team 
and human rights commissioners as speakers. 
Through this initiative, all Tanamalia Project 
teams received education to understand 
human rights and its handling. Security 
teams also attended the training, providing 
Human Rights Training in Tanamalia
them insights into community dynamics and 
how to handle situations, including protests.
In line with our commitment to respecting and 
safeguarding human rights, the implementation 
of the Tanamalia Project has been subjected 
to comprehensive social and environmental 
studies. These studies have yielded multiple 
outcomes, including an assessment of the 
community’s susceptibility to environmental 
impacts and social discord. Furthermore, 
there have been observations regarding the 
intricacies of land ownership among local 
communities in the project vicinity and the 
potential conflicts stemming from resource 
exploitation. The studies also encompass 
problem identification, risk evaluation, risk 
matrices, mitigation strategies, and pertinent 
stakeholder issues. All these insights serve as 
guiding factors for the company in executing 
each phase of the Tanamalia Project.
PT Vale also provides extensive opportunities 
for women to take on roles and maximize 
their capabilities within the operational 
areas, including the Tanamalia Project. 
Currently, the total workforce in Tanamalia 
amounts to 389 individuals, of which 
approximately 33 are women, accounting 
for around 8% of the total workforce.

The Company also fosters communication 
with the community regarding 
the Tanamalia Project through the 
socialization of the Mining Exploration 
Activity and Legal Position of IPPKH in 
the Tanamalia Block. The socialization 
occurred at the Towuti Sub-District 
Office Hall and was attended by all 
stakeholders. During the session, the 
authority granted to PT Vale to conduct 
exploration in the forest area of Tanamalia 
was explained, as provided in Minister of 
Environment and Forestry Decree Number 
SK850MenLHK/Setjen/PLA.0/10/2021. 
This decree outlines PT Vale’s rights and 
obligations in managing a forest area 
covering 17,239.28 Ha. According to the 
decree, there are nine obligations that PT 
Vale must adhere to. On the other hand, 
the Company faces dynamics in the area 
due to the presence of 2 million pepper 
plant stakes managed by local residents 
within an 800 Ha area. We continue to 
conduct awareness campaigns against 
deforestation and communicate with 
land cultivators to gain access to their 
gardens during the exploration activities.
Human Rights Training for 
Security Personnel
In addition to the Tanamalia Project, 
the Company also ensures that security 
personnel know and understand human 
rights through security guard certification 
training from the Indonesian National 
Police in line with Decree of the Chief 
of Police Number 4 of 2020 concerning 
Private Security. Legal and human 
rights topics are included in the training 
curriculum. During the reporting period, 
the number of security guard personnel 
amounted to 435 individuals, consisting 
of PT Vale employees, contractors, 
and outsourced workers provided by 
certified security service providers 
registered with the Indonesian Security 
Service Companies Association. All

Empowerment of  
Persons with Disabilities
One of the vulnerable groups that PT Vale 
focuses on is people with disabilities. Throughout 
2023, we continued and expanded programs 
supporting entrepreneurship among people with 
disabilities to achieve self-reliance. One such 
program is the Woliko Organic Chicken program, 
which involves 13 people with disabilities residing 
in Matompi village, Towuti sub-district. PT Vale 
provided training in Sustainable Environmentally 
Friendly Agriculture (P3SRLB), assistance 
in institutional management and business 
processes, and support for organic chicken 
farming and vegetable cultivation infrastructure. 
The total budget allocated for this program was 
approximately Rp150 million.
Support for  
Indigenous Communities
One of the three blocks, the Sorowako Block, where PT Vale operates, has local 
communities who are indigenous people recognized and recorded in an agreement. 
Throughout the reporting period, the Company did not face any disputes with them, 
nor were there any relocations resulting from mining operations. We continue to engage 
in communication with the local community to find the best solutions to address any 
remaining differences. All (100%) local communities live, work and farm within the active 
operational area. [MM5][MM6][MM9][411-1][EM-MM-210a.2][EM-MM- 210b.2] [EM-MM-310a.2]
In line with the implementation of PT Vale’s Human Rights Policy, our 
commitment to supporting indigenous communities is manifested through:
•	 Effectively managing the potential 
risks and impacts of PT Vale’s 
activities on indigenous land.
•	 Respecting and encouraging governance 
mechanisms that accommodate the 
unique social organizations of each 
community and, as far as possible, 
ensuring gender and generational 
representation to enable effective 
participation from the population.
•	 Providing information to indigenous  
and traditional communities about 
PT Vale’s feedback channels and 
responding to feedback received 
within the timeframe outlined 
in applicable regulations or 
agreements with the community.
•	 Building relationships based on trust 
and respect and advancing the rights 
of indigenous communities to their 
culture, heritage, and way of life.
•	 Recognizing the ownership 
rights over land and water 
and the intangible values 
of natural resources held by 
indigenous communities.
•	 Promoting and documenting the

diversity, equity and inclusion training attended by 1,094 participants.
Diversity and Inclusion Charter 
Our commitments to diversity, equity and inclusion:
1.	 Create an environment that 
respects everyone’s uniqueness, 
in which everyone has an equal 
opportunity to develop their 
potential.
2.	 Create a safe and healthy 
environment in which everyone 
has the freedom to express their 
ideas and opinions and to be 
themselves.

evaluate it, and create a diversity-promoting work environment.
4.	 Show no tolerance for all kinds

PT Vale aims to achieve a 10% 
participation rate of women in 
extractive sector activities by 2023 and 
18% by 2030. We acknowledge that 
this goal is challenging, considering 
the low involvement of women in the 
extractive sector. Our job application 
data for 2023 reveals that female 
applicants accounted for only 21% of 
the total 6,000 applicants. Additionally, 
we acknowledge that the extractive 
industry is still perceived as highly 
masculine, presenting another obstacle 
to increasing female participation.
As of December 31, 2023, the number of 
female employees reached 309, comprising 
10.2% of the total workforce, marking an 
increase from 256 employees, or 8.7% of 
the workforce, in 2022. Among all female 
employees, 35 hold managerial positions, 
accounting for 10.1% of all managerial 
staff within the Company. Additionally, 
14 of these female managerial staff 
members occupy top positions as General 
Managers and Management, representing 
5% of the total female workforce. [405-1] 
In 2023, PT Vale remained inclusive of 
people with disabilities who possess 
the necessary competencies and 
skills for available positions. The 
number of employees with disabilities 
in 2023 amounted to 3 individuals, 
a decrease from 4 individuals in 
2022, representing 0.1% of the total 
workforce. These employees are 
engaged in non-staff and senior staff

in the trade union, employees and 
management have drafted and agreed 
upon the 20th Collective Labor Agreement 
(PKB) for 2023–2025 period, per Law No. 
13 of 2003 on Manpower. The CLA serves 
to safeguard the rights of all employees 
and workers. For foreign workers 
(expatriates), the CLA refers to their 
respective employment contracts. PT Vale 
routinely communicates with the trade 
union, including regarding the renewal 
of the Collective Labor Agreement (CLA), 
which is conducted every two years. The 
CLA also regulates notifying employees 
about operational changes within the 
Company. In support of human rights, PT 
Vale also supports periodic unionizing and

Prioritizing  
Dialogue to Find the

We understand the dynamics

respects the decision of a group of 
Sorowako residents who visited the 
National Human Rights Commission 
office and reported alleged human 
rights violations by PT Vale regarding 
a summons issued to 39 residents 
concerning old camp land. In response, 
the Company remains committed to 
prioritizing dialogue to find the best 
solutions, facilitated by the Regional 
Leadership Forum of East Luwu Regency.
In line with the dialogue, it has been 
agreed to establish a Facilitation Team 
tasked with compiling an inventory of 
issues, including gathering accurate data, 
formulating problem statements and 
solution proposals, and coordinating the 
stages of issue resolution with relevant 
parties. The steps of the Facilitation 
Team refer to the Regent of North Luwu 
Decree No. 50 of 2002 and the Joint 
Agreement dated June 15, 2002, based 
on data of 62 individuals (or their heirs) 
as rightful beneficiaries. In principle, 
PT Vale is prepared to transfer 12 land 
certificates to the community; however, 
the transfer process will be carried out 
once all accompanying issues have been

implementation of health and safety 
measures covers all (100%) employees 
and contractor/vendor workers. There 
are no exceptions for them, including 
other stakeholders visiting/working in 
the PT Vale environment. [403-1][403-8] 
Periodically, as needed, PT Vale 
collaborates with stakeholders 
who may be affected by potential 
emergency conditions threatening 
safety. Collaboration initiatives 
undertaken during 2023 include:
•	 Large-scale inspection of the  
Balambano Dam by the Dam Safety 
Commission Team of the Ministry of 
Public Works and Public Housing (PUPR). 
This inspection is part of the feasibility 
assessment process for extending the 
dam’s operational permit every five 
years. During this activity, the team was 
accompanied by several leaders from PT 
Vale’s Energy and Logistics  
Department.
•	 PT Vale showcased the Robotic 
Monitoring System (RMS) technology 
at the digital reality and geospatial 
event, HxGN LIVE Indonesia 2023, held 
for the first time in Southeast Asia. 519 
participants from various professional 
backgrounds attended the event. The 
RMS technology innovation has been 
in use since late 2019 and was created 
to monitor the safety of three dams 
owned by the company: Balambano 
Dam, Batu Besi, and Karebbe.
•	 Emergency response simulation involving 
firefighting at the Mining Harapan 
Office, Sorowako, as part of PT Vale’s 
participation in Disaster Preparedness 
Day in 2023. The simulation involved 
employees from the Mining Harapan 
Office, the Fire & Emergency Services 
team, and the Health, Safety, and 
Occupational Risk (HSOR) team.
•	 PT Vale and the East Luwu Regency 
Government, through the Regional 
Disaster Management Agency (BPBD), 
held a meeting to update the Emergency 
Action Plan (RTD) document for the Seri 
Sungai Larona Dam (PKM I). According to 
RTD document regulations, it must be 
updated every five years and contains 
systematic instructions, including 
identifying threats to dam safety, 
expediting effective responses to 
prevent dam damage, and preventing or 
minimizing casualties and environmental 
damage caused by dam failure.

Key Hazard 
Identification and 
OHS Training 
The implementation of OHS starts with 
identifying key hazards. It is managed 
through embedded systems/devices in 
operational activities, namely Contractor 
Safety Management System (CSMS), General 
Induction Program (GIP), Site Specific 
Induction Program (SSIP), Risk Assessment 
(RA), Job Safety Analysis (JSA), Safety Talks, 
Critical Activity Requirements (CAR), Safe 
Work Permit (SWP), and audits/inspections. 
PT Vale has mechanisms for employees 
and workers to report unsafe working 
conditions and accidents. The reporting 
procedure for safety monitoring and 
workplace inspection activities is carried 
out through smartphone applications, 
web-based Critical Risk Management 
(CRM), and the IRIS smartphone 
application. During 2023 all conditions that 
endangered safety and health at work 
were addressed, including investigations 
of the incidents that occurred. [403-2]
We have a policy to relocate employees or 
workers from hazardous situations affecting 
their safety and health. Employees have the 
right to refuse unsafe work and report it to 
their supervisors. The company will follow up 
on reported incidents, including conducting 
investigations if necessary. PT Vale has 
identified hazards, assessed risks, and 
implemented controls to mitigate potential 
risks, ensuring they remained manageable 
throughout the reporting year.  [403-2]
The Mining Safety Committee supports the 
implementation of OHS. Through committee 
meetings, employee representatives can 
address various OHS-related issues. In 
2023, the committee held 12 meetings, 
which PT Vale followed up. Employee and 
worker engagement in OHS implementation 
also includes training and certification 
to enhance competencies. In 2023, PT 
Vale conducted 3 OHS training sessions 
attended by 218 employees and 5 workers 
(contractors/vendors). [403-4] [403-5]

Dam Safety and Security 
Management
PT Vale continues to enhance the safety and security of 
its dams. During the reporting period, the Dam Security 
Commission Team from the Ministry of Public Works and Public 
Housing (PUPR) conducted a major inspection at the Balambano 
Dam. This visit was part of the feasibility assessment process 
for the extension of operational permits conducted every 
five years. The inspection covered five aspects: construction 
safety, technological feasibility, social impact, environmental 
impact, and operational governance. Based on the findings, 
the Dam Security Commission Team assessed that the 
Balambano Dam is well-managed by PT Vale’s management.
The Balambano Dam is one of the most advanced dams in 
Indonesia, utilizing Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) technology 
with a capacity of 31.5 million cubic meters of water. In 
addition to visiting the Balambano Dam, the delegation also 
visited the Karebbe Dam. The Dam Security Commission 
Team also observed facilities such as the Upper Gallery, 
Power House, Control Room, and Top DAM at the dams.
The Company is committed to maintaining dam security by 
implementing the Robotic Monitoring System to monitor 
the conditions of the Balambano, Larona, and Karebbe dams 
24 hours a day. Through this technology, in the event of 
any danger around the dams, early warnings will be issued 
connected to the control room, enabling management 
to take prompt action to respond to the warnings.

In 2023, PT Vale’s social programs contributed to achieving the Green PROPER, particularly in the aspect of community 
empowerment program performance, and received recognition from various relevant institutions. This includes the 
Integrated Community Empowerment and Development Program (PPM)/Mining Community Welfare (Tamasya) Award 
2023, newly organized by the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (ESDM). The Company received two out of 
three awards evaluated, namely in the Planning Category and Implementation Category. [413-1][413-2][EM-MM-210b.2]
PPM Master Plan 
Development 2023-2027
As a sustainable development effort, PT Vale has reported to 
the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources the renewal of 
the PPM Master Plan for the 2023-2027 period of the Sorowako 
Block. The second period of PPM program is integrated and 
supports the achievement of SDGs in villages, aligning with 
the development priorities in East Luwu Regency. These 
priorities include economic growth based on non-mining 
sectors such as agriculture, agribusiness, tourism, MSMEs, 
and other creative economic sectors. The second priority is 
to strengthen the quality of education and healthcare and 
achieve village self-reliance, thereby improving the quality of 
life and preparing for post-mining self-reliance in the future.
Based on the evaluation results of the first phase of the 
PPM program, during this second phase, the Company 
implemented data-based program implementation 
targeting poor or vulnerable groups. Consequently, the 
prepared programs will be managed synergistically with 
stakeholders, ensuring that planning refers to data to ensure 
targeting accuracy and avoid favoring specific groups.
The PPM program for the 2023-2027 period will focus on five 
priority areas and combine with the SDGs Village approach, 
which also supports regional economies in developing flagship 
products. In addition to collaboration with local governments, 
the PPM will also collaborate with the Ministry of Energy and 
Mineral Resources and the Ministry of Tourism and Creative 
Economy in developing Creative Villages that can support 
economic development and community welfare, including 
agriculture, livestock farming, fisheries, entrepreneurship 
development, tourism, creative economy, or MSMEs.

Building Synergy with  
the Government
We continue to build synergies with the government in 
implementing PPM programs and activities. In line with the 
implementation of the PPM program for the 2023-2027 period, 
PT Vale launched the Operational Technical Instructions (PTO) 
for the PPM Program to support Sustainable Development 
Goals (SDGs) in villages. The PTO launch event was attended 
by officials from the East Luwu Regency Government, marking 
the beginning of the implementation phase of the PPM-SDGs 
Village Support Program, which synthesizes several program 
models implemented over the past approximately 10 years.
The PTO for PPM-SDGs Village Support serves as the operational 
reference and guideline for all stakeholders in realizing programs 
with broad impacts through accountable and transparent 
governance. The completion of this PTO also provides budget 
certainty, timing certainty, assurance of the programs to be 
funded, and certainty of implementation mechanisms.
Synergy Between PT Vale  
and the Community
PT Vale collaborates with the community in implementing 
several empowerment programs, including:
•	 Training for heavy equipment operators of excavators 
and dump trucks for local talents in the Tanamalia 
Block, East Luwu Regency. The training was attended 
by 52 participants from five villages in Loeha Raya, 
namely Loeha, Rante Angin, Bantilang, Tokalimbo, 
and Masiku. The two-month training covered 
theoretical and practical aspects of heavy equipment 
operation. At the end of the training, those who 
passed the test received competency certificates.
•	 Training in electricity, welding, and basic computer skills 
attended by 64 participants, who were local residents 
from 13 empowerment villages of PT Vale in the 
Morowali mining operation area and two empowerment 
villages of PT Bahodopi Nickel Smelting Indonesia 
(BNSI) in Sambalagi Site. The training lasted for two 
months and aimed to address the biggest challenge in 
Morowali Regency regarding the availability of skilled 
and competitive local workforce, thus supporting 
PT Vale’s commitment to prioritize local talent.
•	 Inaguration of an Organic Field School in 
Ululere Village, East Bungku, Morowali. This 
Organic Field School will be used as a meeting 
place and learning center for farmers from 
13 empowerment villages of the company 
in Morowali Regency. Through the Organic 
Field School, farmers receive training and 
knowledge about organic farming, aiming to 
increase crop yields with efficient production 
costs because some needs, especially 
fertilizers, can be produced and fulfilled 
independently. At the same time, the selling 
price of agricultural products is higher than 
that of conventional farming production.
•	 PT Vale sponsors PSM Makassar, a football 
club from South Sulawesi, during the 
second round of the 2023/2024 Liga 1 
competition. The collaboration is based on 
the consideration that PSM Makassar is 
from the same area as PT Vale’s operations 
and is one of the deserving football clubs 
in Indonesia due to its achievement as the 
champion of Liga 1 last season. Through 
this collaboration, we hope to help develop 
local football talents around PT Vale’s 
operational area and be part of PSM 
Makassar’s football development. We also 
hope to collaborate extensively by involving 
PT Vale’s fostered SMEs through football, 
including during PSM Makassar matches.

children has not been realized due to 
coordination processes, socialization, 
and various dynamics with communities 
and local governments regarding 
governance and beneficiary selection. 
Therefore, the realization of scholarships 
is expected to commence in Q1 2024.
•	 Health Sector: The decrease in budget 
absorption in this sector is largely 
influenced by government policies 
regarding the obligation of every citizen 
to use the BPJS Health card, leading to a 
direct impact on the decrease in regular 
health service financing for the affected 
local communities in the Sorowako block.
PPM supporting infrastructure 
development includes Sorowako, 
Bahodopi, and Pomalaa Blocks, with 
realizations including: 
•	 Subsidized Electricity Facilities for 
Local Communities, Lighting and 
Clean Water Facilities for the General 
Public (US$1,040,778 Sorowako Block)
•	 Infrastructure Development and 
Economic Development of Dongi Ledu 
Ledu Villages (US120,647 Sorowako Block)
•	 Public Facilities and Infrastructure 
(Meeting Halls, Plazas, Road Repairs, 
Water Supply Networks, and Sports 
Facilities) (US$159,899 Sorowako Block)
•	 Village Infrastructure Development 
(Fences, Gabions, Farm Road Pavements, 
Markets, Drainage), Procurement 
of Traditional Bamboo Musical 
Instruments, Tourism Development, 
and Educational Facilities Development 
(US $466,874 Bahodopi Block)
•	 Lighting and Clean Water Facilities 
(US$214,155 Pomalaa Block)
•	 Infrastructure Development 
(Rehabilitation of the Sub-district 
Office in Baula, Development of 
the PNUP Kolaka Campus, and 
Construction of Terminal Embankments 
in Pomalaa) (Total: US$169,026)
•	 Public Facilities and Infrastructure 
Development (Road Asphalting 
and Repairs, Terminal 
Embankment Construction) 
(US$195,804 Pomalaa Block)
OTHER CAUSES
During 2023, PT Vale conducted various 
community care and social assistance 
activities for communities around its 
operations and in other areas across 
Indonesia, including:
•	 Formation and strengthening of 
community institutions (Village-
Owned Enterprises and Subsidiaries, 
youth organizations, farmer 
organizations, women’s groups, herbal 
enthusiasts) - Sorowako Block
•	 Engagement of local communities in 
sustainable environmental conservation 
activities, such as strengthening 
waste banks, tree planting and 
mangrove tracking, fish apartments, 
cleaning community drainage 
channels to preserve the Lake Matano 
ecosystem, assistance for natural 
disaster victims (earthquakes, fires, 
floods), and provision of facilities 
for community places of worship.
The implementation of PPM also includes supporting the development of infrastructure 
to support PPM, with a realization in 2023 reaching US$1,321,323, down by 53% from 
US$2,786,450 in 2022. For the Sorowako Block, the decrease in realization in 2023 is due to 
most of PT Vale’s PPM programs in this period being in a transition phase from planning to 
implementation. Here’s a breakdown:
•	 Transition Phase: The transition of 
program schemes from area-based 
schemes to SDGs Desa support 
schemes requires several stages of 
social preparation, cross-sectoral 
coordination, legal compliance 
processes, and governance framework 
development, which began in 
March 2023. Hence, the realization 
is expected to begin in Q1 2024.

Code of Conduct Compliance and Whistleblowing Chanels  [2-17]
PT Vale has and implements a Code of 
Conduct (CoC) to support the implementation 
of sustainability governance. Every year, we 
held Code of Conduct socialization sessions 
for all parties internally and externally 
associated with PT Vale. Socialization 
activities carried out in 2023 include:
•	 Ethics & Compliance, Anti-bribery and 
corruption Training for all employees.
•	 Anti-bribery & corruption socialization for 
all employees and leaders.
•	 Whistleblowing channel socialization 
through posters, banners, and e-flyers for 
all employees.
•	 Online training on the code of conduct for 
all PT Vale employees.
To support the implementation of the Code 
of Conduct (CoC), the Company provides a 
reporting channel for CoC violations: the Vale 
Whistleblower Channel (VWC), accessible 
24/7 by suppliers, consumers, and other third 
parties. The VWC is connected to Vale S.A.’s 
Ethics and Behavior Code Department and is 
independently managed by a whistleblowing 
service provider in Indonesia. Several channels 
are available for reporting corruption, 
conflicts of interest, discrimination, and other 
perceived violations of regulations or the 
Code of Conduct.  [2-16] 
We guarantee confidentiality, independence, 
neutrality, and immunity in handling, 
investigating, and storing information 
received through the VWC. PT Vale ensures 
that under any circumstances, there will be 
no breaches of confidentiality, intimidation, 
or retaliation against the reporter and no 
tolerance for retaliatory actions. Retaliatory 
actions are considered misconduct. All 
employees are encouraged to report any cases 
of retaliation.  [2-16]
In 2023, the VWC received 32 reports of 
alleged violations submitted through the 
VWC. Issues that can be reported include 
fraud, conflicts of interest, interpersonal 
relationships, relationships with third parties, 
health and safety, and the environment. Of 
the 32 reports received by the VWC, 30 or 
94% were categorized as valid and followed 
up with investigations while maintaining 
confidentiality and protecting the reporter. 
Violation reports included in the VWC are 
reported to the CEO of PT Vale Indonesia 
every three months through a meeting. The 
most investigated violations were related 
to interpersonal relationships and fraud. In 
addition to reports received by the VWC, 
several cases of employee violations were 
addressed by the Company as a whole by 
imposing sanctions for proven violations,

Supporting Anti-Corruption [EM-MM-510a.1] [EM-MM-510a.2]
PT Vale enforces zero tolerance towards 
corruption, bribery, and/or abuse of power 
for personal gain. We are fully committed 
to fostering transparent, accountable, 
and integrity-driven relationships with 
the government and other stakeholders. 
PT Vale has also conducted a risk 
assessment related to corruption and 
identified risks based on the Corruption 
Perceptions Index (CPI) which refers to the 
Vale Global Anti-Corruption Program.
Together with the law firm Hadiputranto, 
Hadinoto & Partners, the Company has 
conducted an assessment to identify 
corruption risks within PT Vale’s 
environment, particularly related to 
procurement processes and activities. We 
implement e-procurement to minimize 
corruption risks and participate in 
contract management transparency, 
including incorporating anti-bribery and 
anti-corruption clauses into agreements 
or contracts with third parties. Another 
approach is to provide the Global Vale 
Anti-Corruption Guidelines on the 
intranet and offer various channels for 
stakeholders to report any violations 
or indications of corruption.[205-1] 
Periodically, PT Vale conducts refresher 
training on anti-corruption for employees, 
as well as for communities and other 
stakeholders. Anti-corruption training 
programs prioritized for employees 
include those in Procurement, External 
Relations, Human Resources, and 
other employees whose work involves 
interactions with government agencies 
or officials. Throughout 2023, we 
communicated and disseminated 
anti-corruption messages via email 
blasts and banners to employees, 
while the dissemination of the PT Vale 
Supplier Code of Conduct Guidelines 
has been conducted for 950 suppliers. 
Additionally, we organized the following 
anti-corruption training:  [205-2] 
•	 Anti-bribery and corruption 
training for new employees.
•	 Anti-bribery & corruption socialization 
for all employees and leaders.
During the reporting period, PT Vale did 
not receive any complaints regarding 
alleged anti-corruption violations, either 
from employees or business partners. 
We have also never been involved in 
any public legal cases related to alleged 
corruption involving the Company. [205-3] 
Respect for Property Rights
The Company also respects property rights in its nickel 
mining operations, including compliance with legal 
frameworks and regulations, as well as respecting rights 
and ownership of land. This commitment underscores PT 
Vale’s dedication to ethical practices and compliance to 
ensure the protection of property rights in all our activities.

Constraints and challenges faced by the Company in implementing sustainability 
during 2023 include various perceptions and interests among stakeholders, especially 
regarding environmental and social (human) management. Another challenge is that 
managing negative impacts requires extensive measurement and documentation. 
At the same time, we are limited in applying all calculation methods. The ongoing 
solution being pursued is to enhance communication and training, as well as monitor 
the recording of calculation data as the basis for performance evaluation.

Economic Value Generated and Distributed
Information on the generated and distributed 
economic value is presented on a cash basis based 
on the audited Financial Statements. The disclosure 
of information follows the recommendations of 
the GRI Standards, so the figures presented may 
differ from the audited Financial Statements. 
Throughout 2023, we recorded a Generated 
Economic Value of US$1.3 billion, marking an 
6.6% growth from 2022, which reached US$1.2 
billion. Part of the Generated Economic Value 
has been distributed to stakeholders. [201-1] 
One factor influencing the economic performance 
in 2023 was the production cost control, which 
amounted to US$10,089 per ton of nickel in 
matte, lower than in 2022, which was US$11,444 
per ton of nickel in matte. The Company did 
not receive financial assistance from the 
Indonesian Government. However, following 
the share ownership structure, the Government 
indirectly holds shares in the Company through 
its ownership of MIND.ID, which has been one of 
PT Vale’s shareholders since 2020.  [201-1][201-4]

Throughout the reporting period, we encountered the effects 
of climate change in the form of irregular weather conditions, 
resulting in weather anomalies that impacted our nickel ore mining 
operations and the shipment of nickel in matte to our buyers. 
This, in turn, led to an increase in operational expenses for PT

also supports transparency and contributes to Indonesia’s EITI 
reporting. During 2023, there were no incidents of tax violations. 
[207-1][207-2] [207-3]
This report only discloses the fulfillment of tax and NTSR obligations 
to the Indonesian government, including central and regional 
governments, considering that PT Vale operates only in Indonesia. 
In 2023, we paid taxes and NTSR to the Government of Indonesia, 
amounting to US$204,617 thousand. This amount increased by 14.3% 
from 2022, reaching US$179,020 thousand.  [207-4]

through taxes. Appreciation was given by the Regional Office 
(Kanwil) of the Directorate General of Taxes (DJP) for South, West, 
and Southeast Sulawesi for the category of corporate taxpayers 
with the highest VAT and income tax contributions throughout 2022. 
Over the past two years (2021-2022), PT Vale has paid local taxes 
amounting to US$50 million or equivalent to Rp700 billion, assuming 
an exchange rate of around Rp14,000. If accumulated from 2011 to 
2022, the Company’s contribution to local taxes has reached US$235 
million or equivalent to Rp3.3 trillion. This figure includes water levy 
fees, which amounted to US$18 million or approximately Rp278 billion

Customer 
Equality [POJK51-F.17]
Based on a long-term contract that 
has been agreed upon, PT Vale sells its 
nickel in matte products to Vale Canada 
Limited (VCL) with a sales percentage 
of 80% and Sumitomo Metal Mining 
Co. Ltd (SMM) with 20%. This market 
certainty ensures that we are not faced 
with market competition from similar 
businesses. We provide equal services 
to buyers, among others, in setting the 
selling price of nickel with reference to 
the London Metal Exchange and cobalt 
with reference to Fastmarket.  [206-1]
Influence  
Towards Communities
In 2023 PT Vale provides pro bono indirect 
benefits to local communities through the 
utilization of infrastructure built for the 
Company’s operational purposes: [203-1]
•	 Road access improvement 
in Loeha Village
•	 Construction of bridges in several 
operational areas, including in Loeha 
Village, to support exploration and the 
needs of the surrounding community
•	 Provision of clean water facilities in 
Mahalona Village as part of the support 
for the Mahalona Block 1 Bridge
Another indirect benefit is the availability 
of job opportunities in local companies 
that act as contractors/suppliers in 
the Company’s supply chain. Local 
companies are defined as businesses 
located and/or operating in PT Vale’s 
operational areas, namely East Luwu 
Regency (Sorowako Block), Morowali 
Regency (Bahodopi Block), and Kolaka 
Regency (Pomalaa Block). The ongoing 
construction work is expected to 
employ 12,000-15,000 workers. They 
will receive wages that can be spent to 
meet living needs, thus bringing about 
a ripple effect on the local economy.
As of December 31, 2023, there are 374 
local companies involved in PT Vale’s 
supply chain, accounting for 16.6% of 
the total number of vendors/suppliers. 
Some of them serve as vendors/
suppliers for development projects in 
Bahodopi and Pomalaa. [203-2][204-1] 
In 2022, the Company conducted a 
community satisfaction index (SMI) 
study related to PT Vale’s business to 
encourage the growth of other economic 
sectors. The study was published in 2023, 
with the following results: [203-2][204-1]
•	 The SMI study (2022) on the MSME 
sector in 4 sub-districts within PT 
Vale’s empowerment areas received a 
score of 2.8, equivalent to a conversion 
value of 70.83% satisfaction of 
respondents with programs that 
promote economic growth.
•	 For the agriculture and sustainable 
fisheries development program, 
the study received a score of 3.0, 
equivalent to a conversion value of 
75% satisfaction of respondents 
with the program’s achievement 
in improving the economic status 
of beneficiary communities.
•	 Overall, the CSR program 
received a score of 3.0, equivalent 
to a conversion value of 74% 
satisfaction of respondents with 
the company’s business operations 
in promoting the economic 
growth of the local community.

and Impact 
Management
 [POJK51-F.27][POJK51-F.28]
PT Vale’s production process and nickel in 
matte products have met the Restriction 
of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) and ISO 
17025:2008 standards, which are European 
Union market standards. They have 
also undergone assessment for mining 
product hazards according to the Globally 
Harmonized System of Classification and 
Labelling of Chemicals (GHS), adopted by 
the United Nations (UN) and implemented 
in Indonesia through Minister of Industry 
Regulation No. 23 of 2013, amending 
Minister of Industry Regulation No. 
87/M-IND/PER/9/2009 on the Globally 
Harmonized System of Classification and 
Labelling of Chemicals. Nickel in matte 
is an intermediate product used as a 
raw material by buyers in subsequent 
processes. Thus, it does not directly 
impact buyers or the environment. There 
have been no complaints about the 
product’s impact on the health and safety 
of employees, workers, or buyers during 
the reporting period. [416-1][416-2] 
Product Recall and Customer 
Satisfaction [POJK51-F.29][POJK51-F.30] 
Throughout 2023, there were no product 
recalls requested by buyers. Shipping of 
nickel in matte to customers was conducted 
using specialized packaging weighing 3.3 
tons. The outer packaging was equipped 
with labels containing information about 
the origin and product specifications, as 
well as handling instructions. We assessed 
compliance with labeling procedures for all 
(100%) products, and no complaints were 
received from buyers regarding information 
discrepancies on the labels. During 2023, 
PT Vale did not incur fines or any other 
legal sanctions related to alleged non-
compliance with marketing communication 
provisions.  [417-1][417-2][417-3] 
We remain committed to maintaining 
product quality and service for our 
customers. Since customers make product 
purchases under long-term contracts, 
we do not conduct customer satisfaction 
surveys. However, PT Vale and customers 
routinely hold monthly meetings to address 
and resolve any issues that may arise.
Data and Digital Information 
Security
PT Vale ensures that all digital data and 
information, including sensitive company 
data, are securely stored, both for 
buyers and employees. We implement 
buyer data security systems to protect 
against data damage, modification, and 
unauthorized dissemination. Data and 
digital information stored by the company 
can only be accessed by authorized parties 
designated by management. Throughout 
2023, there were no reports of data 
damage, modification, or unauthorized 
dissemination (leakage) reported by either 
buyers or employees. [418-1]

· Mixed Hydroxide Precipitate (MHP) 
will be produced from the nickel 
limonite refining and processing 
plant at the Sorowako Limonite 
Project and from IGP Pomalaa. MHP 
production will commence in 2026, 
with a projected total capacity of 
60 kilotons per year in Sorowako 
and 120,000 tons in Pomalaa.
	
· Nickel in ferronickel, produced 
from the nickel ore processing 
plant at IGP Morowali, which will 
commence production starting 
in 2025. The total production 
capacity is expected to reach 73-80 
kilotons of ferronickel per year.
