CITA 
believes 
that 
the 
Company’s 
business 
sustainability is inseparable from the support of the 
community where the Company operates.
Based on 
this, the Company carries out the social responsibility 
or Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) activities as 
an integrated activity with operational activities.
CSR is 
not just a series of activities, but it has to be immersed 
into society and be part of their achievement.
As a mining company, the Company interacts with 
communities and its environment where the Company 
operates.
Through CSR activities, the Company and 
Subsidiaries can provide tangible benefits to the 
community and its surrounding environment that has 
been supporting and contributing to CITA’s business 
continuity.
The slowdown in the mineral and coal sectors due to the 
prohibition  of the raw minerals export has undeniably 
affected the Company’s CSR activities and Subsidiaries.
This is relating to  the Company discontinued its 
production and other operational activities during 
that period.
The Company will work with 
local communities and all stakeholders to accomplish 
these programs.
