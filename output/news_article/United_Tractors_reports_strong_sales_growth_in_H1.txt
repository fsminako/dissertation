The subsidiary of conglomerate Astra International sold 2,873 units of Komatsu heavy equipment from January to June, a 111 percent increase from the 1,361 units marketed in the same period last year. The mining sector contributed 61 percent to total sales, while construction and forestry contributed 18 percent and 12 percent, respectively. In the month of June, the company sold 473 units, 58 percent of which went to the mining sector, which has been thriving on the back of high prices of mining commodities, including coal and nickel. Indonesia’s benchmark coal price (HBA) hit US$323.91 per ton in June – the highest ever since the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry began publishing the HBA in 2009 – but declined slightly to $319 in July, ministry data show. The benchmark price is more than double what it was a year earlier at $115.35 per ton. Read also: Indonesian coal price hits decade high © 2016 - 2024 PT.
