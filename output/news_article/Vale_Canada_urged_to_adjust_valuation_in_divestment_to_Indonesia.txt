He did not reveal the figure in dispute. To reduce the valuation, Erick suggested Vale relinquish some of its areas. “If they do not want to do it, then we must find a proper valuation.,” he said. The divestment is one of the requirements for INCO to obtain a special mining permit (IUPK), which will allow it to extend its mining contract. INCO’s current contract will end in December 2025. To earn a new IUPK, the subsidiary must divest a portion of its shares to state-owned mining holding company MIND ID. As the interim coordinating maritime affairs and investment minister, Erick regarded the high valuation as an obstacle in the ongoing negotiation process. He also noted that the negotiation was still ongoing, despite the differences on price. “It is a tight negotiation, but it doesn’t mean we will cancel [the divestment]. We have implemented the [memorandum of understanding] and have agreed on 14 percent. However, the valuation must be good. This is our responsibility,” the minister added. © 2016 - 2024 PT.
