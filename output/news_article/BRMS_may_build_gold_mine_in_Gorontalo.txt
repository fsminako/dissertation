Publicly listed non-coal miner PT Bumi Resources Minerals (BRMS), a subsidiary of PT Bumi Resources Tbk, may shift its mining business priorities in Gorontalo from copper to gold due to uncertainties in the construction of a copper smelter for which the company will supply Publicly listed non-coal miner PT Bumi Resources Minerals (BRMS), a subsidiary of PT Bumi Resources Tbk, may shift its mining business priorities in Gorontalo from copper to gold due to uncertainties in the construction of a copper smelter for which the company will supply.BRMS' subsidiary, PT Gorontalo Minerals, in March signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to supply copper concentrate to a smelting and refining facility to be constructed by PT Nusantara Smelting.The development of the copper mine would take a minimum of three years to complete, starting from 2015 at the earliest, said Suseno Kramadibrata, BRMS president director.'If the [copper] smelter cannot be completely established by 2019 for [the company's] benefits, we have to run the gold [mine] first,' Suseno told a press briefing at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in Jakarta on Monday.BRMS will wait until the end of this year to ascertain the copper mine development with Nusantara Smelting, while the company looks out for other partners to provide copper smelting and refining facilities for its Gorontalo mine.If things remain uncertain on the copper mine, BRMS will shift its focus to the gold mine, but still at the Gorontalo site, according to Suseno.He argued that the investment would be lower for a gold mine than for a copper mine and the copper mines need more advanced technology than gold mines. Hence, the shift should not be burdensome.'[Also,] the payback period will be quicker [for gold mines compared with copper mines],' Suseno added.The company is developing 292 million tons ore resources from PT Gorontalo Minerals' Cabang Kiri and Sungai Mak sites with an average content of 0.5 percent copper and 0.47 grams per ton of gold.BRMS director Fuad Helmy said that the company this year had allocated around US$60 million for its capital expenditure, of which around $30 million was for the development of the Cabang Kiri and Sungai Mak sites.The company has four mineral mining projects under its subsidiaries, namely PT Dairi Prima Mineral (zinc and lead), PT Gorontalo Minerals (cooper and gold), PT Citra Palu Minerals (gold and molybdenum) and PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara (copper and gold). BRMS has an 18 percent share in Newmont.The company has booked losses for two consecutive years after it closed 2013 in the red with $121 million in net losses and $29.72 million in 2012.Shares in BRMS traded at Rp 240 (2 US cents) apiece on Monday's trading close, up 4.35 percent from the previous day.
