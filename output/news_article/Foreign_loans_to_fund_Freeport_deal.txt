As the rupiah continues to weaken against the United States dollar, state-owned mining holding company PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Inalum) is ditching its plans to finance the purchase of a majority stake in gold and copper miner PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI) using loans from domestic banks by choosing foreign lenders instead As the rupiah continues to weaken against the United States dollar, state-owned mining holding company PT Indonesia Asahan Aluminium (Inalum) is ditching its plans to finance the purchase of a majority stake in gold and copper miner PT Freeport Indonesia (PTFI) using loans from domestic banks by choosing foreign lenders instead.On Friday, Inalum head of corporate communications Rendi Witular said the decision was in accordance with the firm’s revenue, which is in US dollars.“We are afraid that taking out [US dollar] loans from state lenders will cause the rupiah to fluctuate,” he told The Jakarta Post.Inalum said taking out US dollar loans from domestic banks would disrupt the country’s foreign exchange reserves as the company had to pay United States-based miner Freeport-McMoran Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) for the share purchase, meaning there would be an outflow of foreign exchange funds.Taking out US-dollar loans from overseas banks to pay FCX would not put the rupiah exchange rate at risk. On Friday afternoon, the rupiah was recorded at Rp 14,520 against the US dollar, weakening from Rp 14,418 recorded a day earlier, data at the Jakarta Interbank Spot Dollar Rate (JISDOR) shows.Inalum, which represents the government, will prepare US$3.85 billion to complete the long tug-of-war to increase Indonesia’s ownership to 51 percent in PTFI, the operator of world’s largest gold mine Grasberg in Papua.The completion of the share purchase is targeted for August following a non-binding agreement called a heads of agreement (HoA) signed by Inalum and FCX in Jakarta on July 12.FCX currently still controls 90.64 percent of the shares in PTFI, while Inalum only holds 9.36 percent as a result of the government’s transfer of shares at the end of last year.The HoA in July was an agreement for Inalum to buy 40 percent of Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto’s participating interest in PTFI and 100 percent of FCX’s shares in PT Indocopper Investama, another subsidiary of FCX.Inalum president director Budi Gunadi Sadikin said $3.5 billion were allocated for Rio Tinto’s participating interest, while the remaining $350 million were for FCX’s shares in PTFI.Previous reports said Inalum would seek out loans from three state lenders — namely Bank Mandiri, Bank Negara Indonesia (BNI) and Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI) — to finance the majority of the purchase, while the rest would be financed by loans from overseas lenders.The State-Owned Enterprises Ministry’s deputy for financial and business services, Gatot Trihargo, confirmed on Friday that state lenders had decided to withdraw from the plan to fund the divestment process.BNI vice president director Herry Sidharta told the Post on Friday that it was relatively hard for local banks to compete with foreign lenders in terms of interest rates and availability of cash in foreign denominations.Rendi of Inalum said taking out loans from overseas banks would help boost the company’s image globally as a trusted player, pointing out that more than 11 foreign lenders had shown an interest to finance the deal.However, Rendi said the number of prospective participating banks could be fewer than 11 as Inalum would seek competitive interest rates in order to lower the costs.Rendi added that Inalum would not fully depend on foreign loans as the company currently had in internal cash of around $2 billion, adding that PTFI’s future profit would enable Inalum to pay off the debt.Meanwhile, Samuel Asset Management economist Lana Soelistianingsih said opting for a syndicated loan from overseas banks was correct as state-owned banks were already burdened by their support of the government’s infrastructure projects.
