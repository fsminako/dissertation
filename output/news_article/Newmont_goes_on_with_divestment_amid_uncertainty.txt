Copper mining company PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara will continue offering shares to the government to comply with a mandatory divestment rule, though there is no clear indication whether the offer will be accepted Copper mining company PT Newmont Nusa Tenggara will continue offering shares to the government to comply with a mandatory divestment rule, though there is no clear indication whether the offer will be accepted.Meanwhile, the government said that divestment was not a priority at the moment.Under existing regulations, Newmont Nusa Tenggara, the Indonesian unit of US-based Newmont Mining Corp., has an obligation to release 7 percent of its stake to the government. Newmont Nusa Tenggara spokesperson Rubi Purnomo said the company would make another offer to the government to comply with the regulation, despite previous offers having been rejected.'We keep communicating with the government,' Rubi said Thursday.Newmont Nusa Tenggara currently holds a contract of work, signed in 1986, to operate the Batu Hijau mining site in West Nusa Tenggara. The company is currently 56 percent owned by Nusa Tenggara Partnership BV (consisting of Newmont Mining Corp. and Nusa Tenggara Mining Corporation ' an affiliate of Sumitomo Corporation of Japan).As much as 24 percent is owned by PT Multi Daerah Bersaing, a joint venture of the politically wired Bakrie family's Bumi Resources, the West Nusa Tenggara provincial administration and West Sumbawa and Sumbawa regencies. The remaining 17.8 percent is owned by PT Pukuafu Indah, with 2.2 percent owned by PT Indonesia Masbaga Investama.Under the contract, as much as 7 percent of Nusa Tenggara Partnership's stake is to be divested and sold to the government of Indonesia. The divestment process should have been completed in 2011.The divestment process was initially handled by Pusat Investasi Pemerintah (PIP), a government agency. However, the agency has since been merged with PT Sarana Multi Infrastruktur (SMI), another state agency that focuses on infrastructure financing.Finance Minister Bambang Brodjonegoro said earlier that the government no longer intended to purchase the stake under a mandatory divestment scheme, at least for now.'For the time being, we're not talking about it, because there's no budget allocation. Moreover, PIP has been merged with SMI focusing on infrastructure development. It has nothing to do with the mining sector,' the minister said.Purchasing divested shares has frequently presented a problem to the government, as stakes in copper mining firms are usually too costly. Under current regulations, the central government has first option to purchase stakes in mining firms; regional administrations and state- or region-owned enterprises can subsequently ask to buy the shares.The government is currently also evaluating the mandatory divestment of another copper miner, PT Freeport Indonesia, a subsidiary of US-based Freeport McMoRan Inc. Under the current regulation, the firm's foreign owner has to divest a total 20.64 percent so that Indonesian stakeholders can increase the ownership from the current 9.36 percent to 30 percent.In the first stage of divestment, Freeport has to release 10.64 percent, for which the company set the price at US$1.7 billion. The Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry's mineral and coal office remains undecided. Please Update your browser Your browser is out of date, and may not be compatible with our website.
