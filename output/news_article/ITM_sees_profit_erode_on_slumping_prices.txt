Major coal producer Indo Tambangraya Megah (ITM) saw its net profit decrease 60 percent on an annual basis as coal prices have yet to show signs of recovery Major coal producer Indo Tambangraya Megah (ITM) saw its net profit decrease 60 percent on an annual basis as coal prices have yet to show signs of recovery.ITM, according to its newly published financial report, saw its revenue between January and June slump by more than 14 percent from the previous year. The company's top line slipped from the US$965.23 million it booked in the first six months of last year to $824.53 million. The plunging sales directly affected the publicly listed company's first-half net profit, which plunged from $143.85 million to $57.65 million. William Simadiputra, an analyst from DBS Vicker, said the first half result was in line with his projection and that the company was expected to experience contracted results for its 2015 full-year operation.The first six-month result, he said, reflected the bearish commodity market, with ITM's higher sales and production volume falling short in mitigating impacts from plunging coal prices, deeply affecting its financial performance. Indo Tambangraya, as previously reported, plans to produce 30 million tons of coal this year, only slightly up compared with 29.5 million tons last year, as coal prices remain unpredictable. William said that revenue and earnings could drop by 5.9 percent and 14.8 percent year-on-year (yoy) to $1.8 billion and $144 million, respectively, with lower costs partly contributing to slowing prices, impacting its financial performance. According to its financial result, the company deflated its costs of goods sales by 12.3 percent yoy during the first half to $650.28 million.'Coal miners are price-takers, with little pricing power. Operations will be more challenging ahead given abundant supply and slower demand growth because of environmental concerns,' he said.Australia's Newcastle coal, an Asian benchmark, has slumped to about $60 a ton from as much as $136.30 in early 2011. Indonesia's coal price reference (HBA) lost 16 percent of its value in the past year. The bearish trend in coal prices are driven by oversupply in the market, exacerbated by declining demand from China, the world's biggest importer of the commodity, as it strives to curb coal usage to battle pollution. Global supply would outpace demand by 8.5 million tons this year, compared with a balanced market last year, analysts at Morgan Stanley said in report in June. The surplus will expand to as much as 15.8 million tons by 2019.ITM saw declining sales domestically and in almost all of its export destination countries, except to Southeast Asia, India and Pakistan. ITM's local sales decreased 15.4 percent to $92.43 million. The company's exports to Europe, Taiwan, China, Hong Kong, and South Korea were trimmed by 47.51 percent to $205.05 million yoy during the period between January and June.Sales to Japan and to the US slipped by around 24 percent and 39 percent to $167.92 million and $14.2 million, respectively.Meanwhile, exports to Southeast Asian countries, India and Pakistan were up 56 percent to $339.17 million during the period.Currently, Indo Tambangraya operates six mines in Central Kalimantan, East Kalimantan and South KalimantanThe company recently closed commercial operation of its subsidiary, Kitadin ' which operates two mining licenses ' as its reserves depleted.In 2014, the subsidiary contributed 1.92 million tons, or 6.4 percent of ITM's total annual production during the year.
