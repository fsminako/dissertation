The gold and copper mining giant expects to finish the smelter’s commissioning stage by the end of May, which meets the government’s conditions for extending the permit that otherwise would expire that same month. Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Arifin Tasrif stressed that the government had yet to decide whether to grant PTFI the permit extension. “We [the government and PTFI] are both making promises.
