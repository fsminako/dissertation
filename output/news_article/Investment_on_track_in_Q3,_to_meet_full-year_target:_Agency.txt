Around 60 percent of investment in the third quarter would be from foreign investors, he said.'Hopefully the whole-year target can still be attained as in the first semester we already realized nearly half of the aimed figure,' Azhar said, adding that investment commonly peaked in last quarters of each year.New projects include the construction of a $200 million lubricant oil blending plant in Marunda, North Jakarta, by PT Shell Indonesia; a $1 billion alumina refinery in Ketapang, West Kalimantan by PT Well Harvest Winning ' a joint venture between China's top aluminum maker, China Hongqiao Group, and local firms, including PT Cita Mineral Investindo Tbk; a $1 billion autoplant in Cikarang, West Java, by Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corp and a $350 million cement factory in Tuban, East Java, by Jakarta-listed PT Holcim Indonesia, according to records at the agency.

Apart from that, the realized investment will also comprise several ongoing projects such as a $3 billion steel plant made jointly by state-owned steel maker PT Krakatau Steel Tbk. and South Korea's POSCO in Cilegon, Banten, as well as a Rp 1.8 trillion Teluk Lamong multi-purpose terminal near Tanjung Perak Port in Surabaya, East Java.Indonesia largely depends on investment to spur growth and has set a high target of Rp 390 trillion this year.From the January to June period, the country realized a total Rp 192 trillion in investment, or 99.4 percent of its full-year target, up by 30.18 percent from last year.In the second quarter of this year, foreign direct investment (FDI) plunged to its slowest pace of growth since 2010 by 18.89 percent to $66.7 billion. This also contributed to its economic expansion, which in the second quarter touched its lowest level in nearly three years of 5.8 percent.To avert further slowdown, the government last week rolled out a package on incentives, including tax breaks for export-oriented firms, tax breaks for labor-intensive firms and for the improvement of one-stop licensing permits.Bank Mandiri chief economist Destry Damayanti said it would be difficult for the government to attain its estimated investment of more than Rp 100 trillion.'This is due to the fact that our economic indicators are not as good as in previous months,' she said. Destry said that the newly launched government facilities, such as the removal of export quota for unprocessed mineral ores and tax breaks for export-oriented firms as well as labor-intensive firms, might again lure investors to enter mining and manufacturing industrial sectors in the third quarter.Several factors, such as the impact from the Federal Reserve's stimulus cutback and the impact of domestic fuel-price increases, will take effect in the third quarter, while since the second quarter, the loan interests have also been raised by banks, according to Destry.'We predict investors will be more cautious,' she told The Jakarta Post. © 2016 - 2024 PT.
