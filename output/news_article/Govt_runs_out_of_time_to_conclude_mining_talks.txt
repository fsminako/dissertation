Time is slipping away for the government to conclude contract renegotiations with mining companies by yearâs end as no concrete results thus far have been achieved in the talks with big miners Time is slipping away for the government to conclude contract renegotiations with mining companies by year's end as no concrete results thus far have been achieved in the talks with big miners.Several contentious issues such as mining area reductions, the requirement to process ores in local smelters beginning next year and the requirement to increase royalty payments had hampered the renegotiation process, miners said. Many miners have said that building their own smelters was financially unfeasible. The government's requirement to increase the royalty rate has also prolonged renegotiation talks with major miners such as Freeport, as the government's royalty rate is considered too high.Although many contentious issues have yet to be resolved, the Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry is upbeat that renegotiations, including with mining giants Newmont, Vale and Freeport, can be concluded before the year-end deadline.Energy and Mineral Resources Ministry Deputy Minister Susilo Siswoutomo said in Jakarta on Friday that progress had been made in the renegotiations of mining contracts. He said the government had frequently met with mining companies, including big players such as Newmont, Freeport, Weda Bay and Vale to renegotiate their mining contracts so that they would be in line with the 2009 Mining Law.Susilo hoped renegotiations would conclude by year-end as in 2014, mining companies would be required to process their mineral ores in local smelters. Susilo said the energy and mineral resources minister and the House of Representatives would meet next Thursday to discuss the progress of the renegotiations. The renegotiations began in early 2012 as part of the government's efforts to adjust all existing mining regulations, permits and contracts in line with the new mining law.Six important points are being renegotiated, namely mining-area sizes, royalty payments, the obligation to process raw materials in Indonesia, divestment and the utilization of local goods and services.Nickel producer PT Vale Indonesia, which has already built its own processing facilities, said that it still needed to work out some renegotiation details. It said the government had asked for details on the company's major projects that would determine the size of areas the company would continue to hold. Small players, however, also reported good progress. Copper and gold miner PT Citra Palu Minerals, for example, had reached an agreement to reduce the size of its working area to around 99,600 hectares from the previous 138,889 hectares, said Suseno Kramadibrata, the president director of PT Bumi Resources Minerals, which holds a 96.97 percent stake in the company.The Indonesian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (Kadin) has formed a task force that is responsible for providing the government with recommendations, particularly relating to the planned ban on the export of unprocessed ores. Didie Suwondho, the chief the task force, said that Kadin had recently met with members of House Commission VII to raise concerns from miners in regards to complying with the government's requirement of processing ores in local smelters and its ban on exporting raw ores.He said the ban on exporting raw ores should be clarified because it was not stipulated in the law. The law only required mining firms to process their raw mineral products at home to boost the country's downstream mining industry, he said. Industry Minister MS Hidayat said late Thursday that the government would prepare a new regulation for the implementation of the Mining Law to 'accommodate all issues and not disadvantage anyone'.
