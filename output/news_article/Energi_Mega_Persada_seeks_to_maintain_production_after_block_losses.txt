Since late 2016, ENMP produced some 8,600 barrels of oil and 200 million cubic feet of gas per day. Those numbers were a decrease from 11,000 barrels of oil and 215 million cu ft of gas, ENMP investor relations Herwin Hidayat said in a press conference in Jakarta on Wednesday. The decrease followed write-offs of ENMP’s contract worth more than US$300 million last year on some of its largest oil blocks, including the Buzi Block in Mozambique and Offshore North West Java (ONWJ) block in Indonesia. “Fortunately, those were one-off losses, so it will not happen again in the future,” Herwin said.
