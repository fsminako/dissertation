They call it heaven on earth, a place where only certain people should be. For the Sangir people of Sangihe, one of Indonesia’s northernmost islands, located in North Sulawesi, their home is a utopian paradise. A small island, approximately only one-tenth of Bali in size, Sangihe is blanketed in natural resources -- healthy soil, cool clean air and a seemingly endless supply of fish to live from. But these days, these natural resources are under threat of extinction. Sangir women of various backgrounds -- from activists to housewives -- now come together to take a stand against mining companies whose existence may result in the depletion of those resources -- and the survival of the Sangir people. Heaven on earth: The small Sangihe island is home to thousands of Sangir people. (Courtesy of Natu Natasha)
