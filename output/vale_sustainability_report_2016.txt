Maintaining Economic Resilience
Economic resilience as material aspect because it is a 
basis of managing the Company’s operations that lies 
on economic performance.
As existing risks can impact 
the financial performance, the Company has a financial 
management and risk management approach.
The level of nickel in matte production decreased compared 
to 2015 due to maintenance of production facilities.
The 
condition was addressed by applying efficiency to reduce 
cost of production.
The Company applies cost control/
cost improvement through coal conversion program and 
review of partners’ contract based on scale of priority.
Total realization of nickel in matte production in 2016 
reached 77,581 MT, down 3,596 MT from 81,177 MT in 
2015.
Nickel in matte production target for 2017 was 
set to reach 80,000 MT.
The 
economic performance is monitored by the Finance 
Director who reports to President Director.
Generated revenues in the reporting period 
were from nickel mining and processing with the 
reference price from the London Metal Exchange 
(LME).

in reducing production costs and expenses.
In general, we 
ensure our supply chain apply the principles of sustainable 
development in operating their business.
In the stages of 
operation and production, the Company cooperates with 
suppliers and contractors, and put them in supply chain 
management (SCM).
The approach is undertaken 
through Promote National Interest (PNI) program, which is a 
commitment to increasing the portion of domestic content 
level (DCL).
It is in line with Minister of Energy and Mineral 
Resources Regulation No.24 of 2012 on the Implementation 
Mineral and Coal Mining Service Business, which sets a 
target of DCL in 2017 at 62%.
LBI achievement target in 2017 was set at 24%.
In Bahodopi and Pomalaa blocks, we 
have been conducting the prequalification process for 
local suppliers of goods and services.
The prequalification 
process was scheduled to complete in August 2017.
Implementation of e-procurement 
is believed to increase transparency, compliance, 
and prevent any conflict of interest or violation.
While the 
obstacles to be faced include aspects of the product, price, 
communication/promotion and place.
Occupational Safety Accountability	
Occupational Health and Safety is an important 
aspect for the Company due to its high risk operating 
characteristics.
Significant information presented in this report is the 
accountability of occupational safety which is a material 
aspect.
It is applied to include OHS compliance in 
KPI or targets that have been set each year in accordance 
with the Company’s goals.
[G4-14]

During 2016, zero fatality has been achieved and in 
accordance with the target, but the loss of working 
days due to illness remained to be improved.
OHS 
performance was a part of duties and responsibilities of 
the Division of Environment, Health & Safety (EHS), under 
the Deputy Chief Operational Officer (COO), EHS Director 
and Technical Mine Manager.
[G4-DMA]
More than 60% of total employees working outdoor have 
a higher risk of work accidents compared to employees 
working indoor.
The achievement of Safety System 
implementation in 2016 reached 74.77% and will continue 
to be improved to create the Company’s safe and efficient 
operational environment.
The CLA is in effect after being approved by the Ministry 
of Manpower through Decree NO.KEPP.
The provisions on OHS application

AMDAL preparation refers to the 
Minister of Environment Regulation No.5 of 2012, and No.
This issue is important because 
it affects the stakeholders’ decision-making and has 
been regulated by the government through regulation 
of Ministry of Environment No.4/2014 on Standards 
of Emission and Governor Decree No.
The 
Company mitigates environmental risks by measuring 
the emission concentration regularly, installing dust 
catcher electrostatic precipitator (ESP) at dryers and 
kilns and bag house at the smelting furnace.
The information is important to 
be presented in this report and is a material aspect because 
it can influence the stakeholders’ decision-making.
It is in line 
with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
During 2016, particulate emission intensity of processing 
was 13%.
In 2017, the focus will be on the replacement 
of the ESP dust catcher system at Reduction kiln #4.
The performance is directly monitored by 
Environmental Health and Safety Function and are the

SO2 Emission Control and Particulate  [G4-EN21]
In accordance with the Regulation of the Minister of 
Environment No.
4 of 2014 stipulates that SO2 emission 
quality standard is determined based on the emission 
intensity by mass balance calculation, equating the weight 
of emitted SO2 to the weight of products (tons of SO2/ton 
product).
All sulfur input from pure sulfur, fuel, and coal are 
calculated in the mass balance.
The efforts made during 2016 
to control and reduce SO2 emissions are:
• 
improve more systematic and consistent 
sulphur addition control
• 
sulphur addition system modification 
to add efficiency
• 
improving nickel product recovery
Discharge of SO2 emissions has met the quality standard 
threshold established by the Government.
Types of emissions that 
are relevant to the Company's activities is SO2.
The Company continues to maintain ambient air quality to 
meet the standard by conducting regular measurement of 
particulate concentration.
By the end of 2016, 94% of the energy 
for operating activities originated from hydroelectric 
power plant (PLTA).
While 
in the processing area, the 
Company did not set any 
target on energy efficiency due 
to efforts to maintain the quality 
of production and processing 
plant facilities.
The Company fully utilizes the 
power plants for processing operations and does not make 
any sales of energy.
The energy is calculated by the summation method of volume 
of energy sources, and then are converted into energy unit 
(gigajoules or GJ).
Total energy consumption during 2016 
reached 26,525,185.67 gigajoules (GJ), down 2,027,106.73 GJ 
or 7.09% compared to 28,552,292.40 GJ in 2015.
The decline of 
energy consumption was due to decline in production.
Power supply from 
renewable energy managed to reduce the consumption of 
HSFO by 400,000 barrels and HSD by 64,000 barrels.
Total energy consumption for each ton of nickel in matte 
production or energy intensity in 2016 reached 343.36 GJ/ton.
Measurement of energy intensity covers the Company and 
contractors.
It was 2% lower than 351.73 GJ/ton in 2015.
This 
is achieved because of their efficiency to reduce the level of 
energy consumption.
[G4-EN3]
The volume of power consumption from hydroelectric power 
plants in 2016 reached 9,004,921.51 GJ or 33.9% of total 
energy consumption.
The Company supplies 10.7 MW of electricity to PT PLN to 
be distributed to the community.
PT PLN pays at the agreed 
price, which is then handed to the local governments as 
grants.
Total volume of biodiesel consumption in 2016 amounted to 
76.8 million liters, up significantly compared to 2015, which was 
28 million liters.

on Wastewater Quality Standard for Business and/or Nickel 
Ore Mining Activities.
Compliance with waste management is 
conducted by the Health, Safety, and Environment function to 
ensure it runs properly and supervised by the Director of EHS.
The Company monitors and ensures the waste management 
regularly.
The Company involved accredited laboratory to 
measure the concentration parameters of effluent quality 
to quality standard.
This increase was confirmed to have 
no significant effect on the environment.
The average 
concentration of TSS content of all points of compliance in 
2016 was 11.04 mg/liter against the quality standard of 200 
mg/liter.
There were no community complaints about the 
Company’s waste.
Solid Waste Management [G4-EN23][MM3]
Solid waste from mining operations consists of 
overburden and topsoil.
Nickel ore processing activities 
generate waste furnace slag and converter slag.
101 furnace slag has been 
listed as LB3 under hazard-2 category with waste code B403.
Converter slag waste can potentially be reused by the Company 
as production material.
Effluent Management 
and Treatment [G4-EN22]
Effluent generated from operating activities of nickel 
ore mining and processing is managed through the 
mechanism of water quality improvement from effluent.
There was no 
treated water reused by other parties.

Nickel ore mining is an open cast mining or carried out on the 
surface.
The post-mining land will then be 
reclaimed and rehabilitated.
In the mining operations during 2016, it is ascertained that no 
protected species of fauna and flora found in the mine sites.
The area of disturbed ​
land due to mining activities in 2016 
reached 5,340.55 ha, and the total area of ​
