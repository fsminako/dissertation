Management
Environmental Sustainability 
Performance Highlights [POJK51-B.2]
ICMM principles:  
Environmental Performance   Conservation of Biodiversity  
Responsible Production
We express our commitment to environmental management 
through a declaration to achieve Net Zero Emission in scopes 
1 and 2 by 2050, in line with the Paris Agreement.
We contributed 44% to the Gross Regional Domestic Product of East 
Luwu Regency, the largest in the mining sector.
Sorowako Airport management by the 
provincial government is expected to support tourism and agribusiness 
in East Luwu and South Sulawesi in general.
To implement the operational plan in Bahodopi, 
we organized a public consultation and environmental impact 
assessment on July 29, 2022.
22/2021 on Environmental 
Protection and Management.
Most of the employees are locals 
from East Luwu Regency and other 
regencies in South Sulawesi.

By adopting the ICMM Sustainable 
Development Framework principles, we 
oversee our production processes and 
ensure that our mineral (nickel) products are 
the results of responsible production.
We ship our nickel in matte 
in special packaging, entirely collected back 
by the buyers.
An increase in 
the demand for nickel will lead to the 
Company’s positive financial performance in 
the coming years.
We do not calculate biogenic 
CO2 emissions.
Based on the 
calculation, the total GHG emissions in 2022 
decreased by 9.4% from those in 2021 and 18.54% 
from the 2017 baseline.
Our strategy 
is to encourage suppliers and customers to be 
committed to reducing emissions from their 
activities.

Restatement of the 2021 and 2020 data in the 2021 Sustainability Report due 
to data update.
We continue to develop 
opportunities to reduce GHG emissions from production processes with 
a potential of 1,800 kilotons of CO2eq, or 90% of the total GHG emissions.
We are committed to reducing absolute greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions from scopes 1 and 2 by 33% by 2030 and achieving a net zero 
emission by 2050.
The trials have been carried out, covering a distance of 
10,326 km and reducing 2.73 tons of CO2eq.
•	Trial of an electric truck starting August 4, 2022, in 
the Sorowako Block for a year.
The truck has a payload

All R32 freon is purchased 
from suppliers.
We are 
controlling our SO2 emissions

In this reporting period, we initiated a dialogue 
with the Special Task Force for Upstream Oil and

The HPAL plants in 
Pomalaa and Sorowako will produce 
Mix Hydroxide Precipitate (MHP), raw

We have communicated 
this plan to stakeholders, including the government and 
surrounding communities.
The plan covers the entire (100%) 
mining operation area in Sorowako.
Provincial financial allocations, which 
include an environmental cost component in our Financial 
Statements, support our commitment to land reclamation

ISO 50001 is a globally-recognized standard 
that sets requirements for developing, 
implementing, maintaining, and improving 
an energy management system in a 
company.
The ISO 50001 certification is a critical 
milestone in the Company’s effort to 
meet the commitment to reducing and 
neutralizing greenhouse gas emissions, 
consistent with the statement in the 26th 
Conference of Parties (COP-26) in 2021 in 
Glasgow, Scotland.
We will carry out the rehabilitation 
until 2025.
Some of the operation areas are in protected forests.
The Ministry of Energy and 
Mineral Resources regularly 
monitors and evaluates 
its success to ensure the 
rehabilitated areas are 
eligible for handover to the 
government through the 
Ministry of Environment and 
Forestry.

Environmental Sustainability Management Performance 
Protecting Biodiversity [POJK51-F.10]
We manage the species affected by our 
mining activities by identifying and relocating 
them to other areas, including post-mining 
rehabilitated areas.
The total area we 
reclaimed in 2022 was 295.43 Ha, or 1% of the 
293.44 Ha target, with 179,993 trees planted.
We target over 10,000 Ha to be reclaimed and 
rehabilitated by 2024.
We are gradually handing 
over the rehabilitated areas to the government 
for reforestation.
A 
study conducted in collaboration with the 
University of Hasanuddin in 2020 found 43 
protected species based on the IUCN Red List 
in our mining operation area in the Sorowako 
Block.
The species list can be found in the 
Appendix hereto.
Prior to the final waste disposal 
stage, we treat our waste through efforts to reduce, 
reuse, recycle, and recover (4R).
In the reporting 
period, no hazardous and toxic waste was shipped 
internationally, and no environmentally endangering 
waste was spilled.
Water from the lakes 
flows into a reservoir and is channeled to a 
canal to move the turbine.
The amount of 
water consumed is the same as the water 
extracted from the lake, and no water is 
extracted from the water stress area.
[303-1][303-2]
[EM-MM-210b.1] 
The total water consumed in 2022 was 
8,519,762 m3 (equivalent to 8,519.167 
megaliters), a decrease of 161,558 m3 
(equivalent to 161.558 megaliters) or 1.86% 
from the 8,681,643 m3 consumed in 2021.
The water consumption intensity in 2022 
was 141.77 m3/Ton Ni (0.14 megaliters/
Ton Ni), higher than the 132.85 m3/Ton 
Ni (0.13 megaliters/Ton Ni) in 2021 due 
to a decrease in production.
Impact of Wastewater 
and Its Management  
[POJK51-F.9] [POJK51-F.14]
We regularly analyze 
processed effluent that 
will be discharged to 
Lake Matano through its 
tributary.

Quality Standards for Nickel 
Ore Mining Businesses and/
or Activities.
An 
analysis conducted in 2022 
found that the quality of 
our processed effluent met 
the quality standards.
An 
evaluation carried out in 2022 found that we had 
100% compliance.
Social

in this reporting period is
