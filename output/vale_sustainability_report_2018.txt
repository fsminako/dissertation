The economic 
performance achievement in 2018 was influenced by nickel in matte production and 
sales volume, efficiency policies, and the improvement in world nickel prices.
Policy: Hydroelectric power plant operations, efficiencies and innovations.
Commitment: Increased production and revenue.
•	
Total nickel in matte production 
reached 74,806 MT, or 97% 
of the 77.000 MT target.
•	
Determination of work 
plans and budgets, including 
Company performance targets.
•	
Determination of key 
performance indicator (KPI), 
containing performance 
targets for the Board of 
Commissioners, Board 
of Directors and other 
company officials.
The total electric power 
production at peak loads reaches 365 MW.
Some of the revenue 
earned was distributed to stakeholders, including through 
dividends.
There is no other acceptance 
obtained by The Company as benefits or financial rewards 
from managing climate change.
The electric power distribution is carried out through 
the local PT PLN (Persero).
•	 There is a change in Payments to Government 2017 and 2016 data.
In 2018, 
the minimum rate paid to workers at the lowest level was 
120% above the East Luwu Regency DMW.
The total volume of nickel in matte exported at that 
time reached 4,484.53 Tons.
The 
CI realization by the end of 2018 included 7 projects that 
have been approved and executed.
These projects included 
improvement initiatives and increased performance of 
operating tools, systems, and a work culture that prioritized 
occupational health and safety.
A testing tool for large 
capacity electric motors initiated by the Electrical Shop - 
Central Maintenance Team.
THE TIRE MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT PROJECT, 
initiated by the Mobile Equipment Maintenance 
Division, succeeded in extending the life span of heavy 
equipment tires.
PITEA PIT STOP, initiated by the Mines Department.
Konde and Anoa.
DRYER BURNER IMPROVEMENT, initiated by the Process 
Plant Operation, Process Plant Maintenance and the Process 
Plant Engineering Teams.
After the implementation of the 
project, only 20-21 kg of HSFO is needed, a saving of 
more than 1.5 kilograms.
With these savings, in 2019 the 
Company can save 3,000 tons of coal for Dryer 1.
IN HOUSE INNOVATIONS, to reduce delay and increase the 
lifespan of air pipes in kilns.
The air pipe functions to drain 
additional air for the combustion process inside the kiln.
These 
innovations can increase the life span of air pipes from 3-4 
months to 9 months.
This innovation 
changes the combustion system by modifying the pressure 
from the high pressure pump from 12 bars to 25 bars, and 
changes the burner tip specifications by adding an interlock 
system for regulating HSD and air intake.
An innovation aimed to 
saving diesel fuel by applying a Fuel Saving Control (FSC) 
system on the truck cam between the ECM and Throttle 
sensors.
These 
processes and products follow the Restriction of Hazardous 
Substance (RoHS) for manufacturing and electronic equipment, 
which were adopted by the European Union in 2006.

and the hydroelectric power plant operations, as a follow-
up to the tectonic earthquake on September 28, 2018 that 
rocked Donggala, Central Sulawesi with a magnitude of 7.7 
on the Richter Scale.
In accordance with the standard operating procedures (SOP), 
the Company checked the condition of the dams after the 
earthquake.
After that, data collection was carried 
out on dam instruments (both operational and earthquake 
measuring instruments).
From the results of the special inspections carried out, the 
Company declared the hydroelectric power plants and dams 
were safe.
•	 Installation of Collision Avoidance System 
(CAS) for vehicles entering the mine area.
The 
evaluation is the responsibility of the Chief Mine Technical 
Officer and the Chief Operating Operator (COO).

workers to implement work safety.
In 2018 the 
audit was carried out by Internal Auditor, with the results 
of the compliance level of the Mineral and Coal Mining 
Safety Management System at 89.9%.
This was an increase 
compared to 87.7% in 2017.
This is influenced by the level of 
compliance with the elements of Planning and Organization 
and Personnel.
These activities are carried out through Job 
Safety Analysis (JSA), Safety Talks, Critical Activity Requirements

Occupational Health [403-10]
Special attention is paid to employees and other workers 
who work with a high risk of workplace safety and health.
In addition there are 20 types of work with 
a high risk of occupational health due to dangerous gas 
poisoning, hearing loss and heat stress.
During 2018 no 
workers suffered injuries/illnesses due to work.
The health check-ups are 
conducted at the INCO Hospital in Sorowako.
Health promotion programs implemented in 
2018 included: [403-6]
• Healthy Heart Gymnastics
• Drug Prevention 
• Diphtheria awareness
• Prevention of LBP, Influenza, and Stretching in the 
Workplace.
Socialization is conducted at the safety meeting.
By the end of 2018, 41 INCO hospital workers had been 
dismissed.
The dialogue was due to the 
laid-off workers refusing to be dismissed and demanding they 
continue to be employed, while the layoff decision was based 
on the fact that their employment contracts had ended.

During 2018 the energy consumption 
sourced from hydroelectric power plant electricity reached 
9,094,556 GJ.
This is equivalent to 35% of the total energy 
consumption of 25,904,448 GJ, and lower than the 9,194,231 
GJ in 2017.
This is due to the power demand furnace and the 
problems in the hydroelectric power plant unit.
Biodiesel is

In 2014 the Company built the Lamella Gravity Settler 
(LGS) facility for processing effluent liquids from mining 
operations.
The LGS facility is integrated with the 
Pakalangkai Waste Water Treatment that is connected 
to 17 of the 85 settling ponds and other hydrological 
facilities, with a capacity of 16 million cubic meters, in the 
Sorowako and Petea Blocks.
The LGS facility minimizes the Chromium Valence 6 (Cr6+), 
Chromium Total (Cr Total) and TSS content, and other waste 
water contents from the mining area to below the quality 
standards set by the Government.
Maintaining the processed liquid waste quality 
will impact the preservation of the lakes water quality.
This is 
evidenced by the absence any fines / sanctions or other legal 
sanctions from the authorities, for alleged pollution emanating 
from the release of processed liquid waste into water bodies.
All controlling facilities are built in 
a tiered manner from upstream to downstream based on the 
planned mining activities, and function to ensure processed 
runoff water returns to the water bodies after fulfilling quality 
standards in accordance with Government regulations.
These 
results are regularly reported to the regional government 
and the central government.

25,904,447.91 GJ, a decrease of 505,441.94 GJ, or 1.9%, 
from 26,381,630 GJ in 2017.
This was due to decreasing

The electricity supply is distributed to the 
communities in East Luwu Regency, South Sulawesi.
This was higher than 343.83 GJ / ton in 2017 due 
to the reduced nickel production.
SO2 emissions are released into the air through the 
nickel ore processing facility chimneys during the nickel 
in matte production process.
The emission calculation is stated as a mass balance, by 
determining the intensity of the emission through the 
weight ratio of SO2 emitted by the weight of the resulting 
product.
The SO2 emission calculation is stated in kg/kg Ni.

As of the end of 2018, efforts have been made to preserve 
biodiversity by conducting post-mining land reclamation.
Seeds for rare endemic species, obtained from the location, 
or by buying from the community, are propagated at 
the nursery center.
Seeds from the nursery center are then planted in the post-
mining rehabilitation areas.
To support the plan, the Company 
has prepared Rp32 billion in funds, and has involved the 
community and academicians / researchers from LIPI, 
Hassanudin University and Bandung Technology Institute.
The realization of the TRWS development plan as at the end 
of 2018 included:
