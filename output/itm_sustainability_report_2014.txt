public waterways.
ITM regularly monitors the effect of the water 
returned to public waterways on the local 
biodiversity.
Our results consistently indicated that 
the water we discharged had no such negative 
impact.
The results from monitoring the aquatic 
biota demonstrated that the waterways in areas 
surrounding ITM’s operations had suffered no 
significant disturbance, as indicated by the AMDAL 
diversity index value.
Control of Emissions
We control our emissions of greenhouse gases 
(GHG) as part of our concerted effort to mitigate 
the impacts of climate change.
ITM has measured GHG emissions for Scope

All these substances 
are stored in temporary storage facility for 
hazardous and toxic materials.
101/2014 on the Management of Hazardous and Toxic 
Waste.
Hazardous 
and toxic waste management efforts are submitted 
regularly to relevant authorities.
We transform organic waste into fertilizer 
and encourage local communities to follow our 
step.
We purchase organic fertilizer from the 
communities to be applied on our revegetated 
post-mine areas.
Coal mining processes inevitably produce Acid 
Mine Drainage (AMD), which results from Potential 
Acid Forming (PAF) materials.
PAF materials are 
sequestered and encapsulated by NAF materials 
and then covered with topsoil, which will be 
subsequently revegetated.
Environmental Monitoring
Monitoring of environmental conditions is 
carried out regularly at all mining areas and the 
surroundings, with the aim of preventing and 
mitigating environmental degradation due to our

777 ha of post-mine land and maintained plants 
planted in prior years.
Conservation of Biodiversity 
ITM’s operational areas are situated in or adjacent 
to areas designated as production forest or 
protected forest.
To minimize our mining impacts on the local 
biodiversity, we conduct environmentally-sound 
mining practices only on our IUP areas, after which 
we immediately commence the stage of habitat 
restoration.
These plants will then be categorized 
and cultivated and then reintroduced through 
planting in the reclamation and rehabilitation areas.
